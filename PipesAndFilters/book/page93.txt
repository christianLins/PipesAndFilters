Section  2.  
  Information about the Mission of Pro- 
ject Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenbe-   
rg-tm is synonymous with the free buti- 
ribution of
electronic works in forma- 
ts readable by the widest variety of    
computers
including obsolete, old,     
middle-aged and new computers.  It exi- 
sts
because of the efforts of hundreds 
of volunteers and donations from
pe-   
ople in all walks of life.

Volunte-  
ers and financial support to provide    
volunteers with the
assistance they    
need are critical to reaching Project   
Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that 
the Project Gutenberg-tm collection     
will
remain freely available for gene- 
rations to come.  In 2001, the Pro-     
ject
Gutenberg Literary Archive Fou-   
ndation was created to provide a secu-  
re
and permanent future for Project    
Gutenberg-tm and future generati-       
ons.
