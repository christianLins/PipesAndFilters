the end of the song.

"What trial is  
it?" Alice panted as she ran; but the   
Gryphon only
answered "Come on!" and   
ran the faster, while more and more     
faintly
came, carried on the breeze    
that followed them, the melancholy      
words:--

          "Soo--oop of the  
e--e--evening,
              Beauti-

CHAPTER  
XI


[Sidenote: _Who Stole the       
Tarts?_]

THE King and Queen of Hea-  
rts were seated on their throne
when   
they arrived, with a great crowd asse-  
mbled about them--all sorts of
little  
birds and beasts, as well as the whole  
pack of cards: the Knave
was standing  
before them, in chains, with a soldier  
on each side to
guard him; and near    
the King was the White Rabbit, with a   
trumpet in one
hand, and a scroll of   
parchment in the other. In the very     
middle of the
court was a table, with  
a large dish of tarts upon it: they     
looked so

there seemed to be no chance 
of this, so she began looking about     
her, to
pass away the time.

Alice   
had never been in a court of justice    
before, but she had read
about them in 
books, and she was quite pleased to     
find that she knew the
name of nearly  
everything there. "That's the judge,"   
she said to
herself, "because of his   
great wig."

The judge, by the way,   
was the King; and as he wore his crown  
over the
wig, he did not look at all   
comfortable, and it was certainly comi- 

becoming.

"And that's the jury-bo-  
x," thought Alice, "and those twelve    
creatures,"
(she was obliged to say    
"creatures," you see, because some of   
them were
animals, and some were       
birds,) "I suppose they are the juro-   
rs." She said
this last word two or    
three times over to herself, being      
rather proud of
it: for she thought,   
and rightly too, that very few little
