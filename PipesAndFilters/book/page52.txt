amonds, and walked two and two, as the  
soldiers did. After these came
the     
royal children; there were ten of them, 
and the little dears came
jumping      
merrily along hand in hand, in couples; 
they were all ornamented
with hearts.  
Next came the guests, mostly Kings and  
Queens, and among
them Alice recogni-  
sed the White Rabbit: it was talking in 
a hurried,
nervous manner, smiling at  
everything that was said, and went by   
without
noticing her. Then followed    
the Knave of Hearts, carrying the       
King's
crown on a crimson velvet       
cushion; and last of all this gra-      
nd
procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN 
OF HEARTS.

Alice was rather dou-     
btful whether she ought not to lie down 
on her face
like the three gardeners,  
but she could not remember ever having  
heard
of such a rule at processions;   
"and besides, what would be the use of

When the procession came opposite 
to Alice, they all stopped and loo-

the
Knave of Hearts, who only bowed    
and smiled in reply.

"Idiot!" said   
the Queen, tossing her head impatie-    
ntly; and turning to
Alice, she went   
on, "What's your name, child?"

"My   
name is Alice, so please your Majesty," 
said Alice very politely;
but she      
added, to herself, "Why, they're only a 
pack of cards, after
all. I needn't    
be afraid of them!"

"And who are     
_these_?" said the Queen, pointing to   
the three gardeners
who were lying     
round the rose-tree; for, you see, as   
they were lying on
their faces, and    
the pattern on their backs was the same 
as the rest of
the pack, she could     
not tell whether they were gardeners,   
or soldiers,
or courtiers, or three of
