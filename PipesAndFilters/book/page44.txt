 ked at Alice.

"_I'm_ not a mile high," said Alice.

"You are,"  
said the King.

"Nearly two miles high," added the Queen.

"Well,
  I sha'n't go, at any rate," said Alice: "besides, that's not a
re- 
 gular rule: you invented it just now."

"It's the oldest rule in  
 the book," said the King.

"Then it ought to be Number One," said  
 Alice.

The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily. "Co- 
 nsider your
verdict," he said to the jury, in a low trembling voi- 
ce.

"There's more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty," said
 the White
Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry: "this paper has just
  been picked
up."

"What's in it?" said the Queen.

"I haven't  
opened it yet," said the White Rabbit, "but it seems to be a
letter,
 written by the prisoner to--to somebody."

"It must have been tha-
  t," said the King, "unless it was written to
nobody, which isn't   
usual, you know."

"Who is it directed to?" said one of the juryme-
 n.

"It isn't directed at all," said the White Rabbit; "in fact,  
there's
nothing written on the _outside_." He unfolded the paper as 
  he spoke,
and added "It isn't a letter after all: it's a set of   
 verses."

"Are they in the prisoner's handwriting?" asked another  
  of the jurymen.

"No, they're not," said the White Rabbit, "and   
  that's the queerest thing
about it." (The jury all looked puzzle-  
 d.)

"He must have imitated somebody else's hand," said the King.  
 (The jury
all brightened up again.)

"Please your Majesty," said  
the Knave, "I didn't write it, and they
can't prove that I did: the-
re's no name signed at the end."

"If you didn't sign it," said the
 King, "that only makes the matter
worse. You _must_ have meant some
    mischief, or else you'd have signed
your name like an honest    
 man."

There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the  
first really
clever thing the King had said that day.

"That _pro-
ves_ his guilt, of course," said the Queen: "so, off with----"

"It
 doesn't prove anything of the sort!" said Alice. "Why, you don't
e-
 ven know what they're about!"

"Read them," said the King.

The  
White Rabbit put on his spectacles. "Where shall I begin, please
yo-
  ur Majesty?" he asked.

"Begin at the beginning," the King said   
 gravely, "and go on till you
come to the end; then stop."

There  
was dead silence in the court, whilst the White Rabbit read out
the-
    se verses:--

          "They told me you had been to her,
    
             And mentioned me to him:
           She gave me a good 
character,
             But said I could not swim.

           He 
 sent them word I had not gone,
             (We know it to be tru- 
e):
           If she should push the matter on,
             What 
would become of you?

           I gave her one, they gave him two-
,
             You gave us three or more;
           They all retu-
rned from him to you,
             Though they were mine before.


           If I or she should chance to be
             Involved in 
    this affair,
           He trusts to you to set them free,
    
             Exactly as we were.

           My notion was that you
   had been
             (Before she had this fit)
           An   
  obstacle that came between
             Him, and ourselves, and   
     it.

           Don't let him know she liked them best,
     
              For this must ever be
           A secret, kept from
