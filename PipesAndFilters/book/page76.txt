said the King: "leave out that          
part."

"Well, at any rate, the       
Dormouse said----" the Hatter went on,  
looking
anxiously round to see if he   
would deny it too: but the Dormouse     
denied
nothing, being fast asle-       
ep.

"After that," continued the      
Hatter, "I cut some more
bread-and-bu- 
tter----"

"But what did the Dormouse 
say?" one of the jury asked.

"That   
I can't remember," said the Hatte-      
r.

"You _must_ remember," remarked   
the King, "or I'll have you execute-    
d."

The miserable Hatter dropped his 
teacup and bread-and-butter, and        
went
down on one knee. "I'm a poor     
man, your Majesty," he began.

"Yo-   
u're a _very_ poor _speaker_," said the 
King.

Here one of the guinea-pigs    
cheered, and was immediately suppressed 
by
the officers of the court. (As      
that is rather a hard word, I will      
just
explain to you how it was done.   
They had a large canvas bag, which tie- 
d
up at the mouth with strings: into   
this they slipped the guinea-pig,
head 
first, and then sat upon it.)

"I'm   
glad I've seen that done," thought Ali- 
ce. "I've so often read in
the newspa- 
pers, at the end of trials, 'There was  
some attempt at
applause, which was    
immediately suppressed by the officers  
of the
court,' and I never understood  
what it meant till now."

"If that's  
all you know about it, you may stand    
down," continued the
King.

"I can't 
go no lower," said the Hatter: "I'm on  
the floor, as it is."

"Then you may  
_sit_ down," the King replied.

Here  
the other guinea-pig cheered, and was   
suppressed.

"Come, that finishes the 
guinea-pigs!" thought Alice. "Now we    
shall get
on better."

"I'd rather   
finish my tea," said the Hatter, with   
an anxious look at
the Queen, who was  
reading the list of singers.

"You    
may go," said the King; and the Hatter  
hurriedly left the court,
without even 
waiting to put his shoes on.

"--and  
just take his head off outside," the
