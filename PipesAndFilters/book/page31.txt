  have come, or at least one
of them." In another minute the whole   
 head appeared, and then Alice put
down her flamingo, and began an  
account of the game, feeling very glad
she had some one to listen to
   her. The Cat seemed to think that there
was enough of it now in   
sight, and no more of it appeared.

"I don't think they play at all
  fairly," Alice began, in rather a
complaining tone, "and they all  
 quarrel so dreadfully one can't hear
oneself speak--and they don't  
seem to have any rules in particular; at
least, if there are, nobody
   attends to them--and you've no idea how
confusing it is all the   
 things being alive; for instance, there's the
arch I've got to go  
  through next walking about at the other end of the
ground--and I   
  should have croqueted the Queen's hedgehog just now, only
it ran   
away when it saw mine coming!"

"How do you like 
the Queen?" said the Cat in a low voice.

"Not at all," said Alice:
  "she's so extremely----" Just then she noticed
that the Queen was  
close behind her listening: so she went on,
"----likely to win, that
 it's hardly worth while finishing the game."

The Queen smiled and
  passed on.

"Who _are_ you talking to?" said the King, coming up  
     to Alice, and
looking at the Cat's head with great curiosi-     
ty.

"It's a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat," said Alice: "allow me
 to
introduce it."

"I don't like the look of it at all," said the
  King: "however, it may
kiss my hand if it likes."

"I'd rather  
  not," the Cat remarked.

"Don't be impertinent," said the King,   
  "and don't look at me like that!"
He got behind Alice as he spo-  
  ke.

"A cat may look at a king," said Alice. "I've read that in   
 some book,
but I don't remember where."

"Well, it must be remo- 
ved," said the King very decidedly, and he called
to the Queen, who 
was passing at the moment, "My dear! I wish you would
have this cat 
removed!"

The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties,
 great or small.
"Off with his head!" she said, without even looking
  round.

"I'll fetch the executioner myself," said the King eage- 
rly, and he
hurried off.

Alice thought she might as well go back 
and see how the game was going
on, as she heard the Queen's voice in
   the distance, screaming with
passion. She had already heard her   
sentence three of the players to be
executed for having missed their
 turns, and she did not like the look of
things at all, as the game 
was in such confusion that she never knew
whether it was her turn or
   not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.

The hedgehog was   
 engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed
to Alice an  
excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the
other: the
 only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to the
other
   side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a helple-  
 ss
sort of way to fly up into one of the trees.

By the time she  
had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight
was over, and
 both the hedgehogs were out of sight: "but it doesn't
matter much,"
  thought Alice, "as all the arches are gone from this side
of the  
ground." So she tucked it under her arm, that it might not escape
a-
   gain, and went back for a little more conversation with her fri-   
 end.

When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to  
  find quite a
large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute
