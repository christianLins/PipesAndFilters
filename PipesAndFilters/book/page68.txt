ths; and
the reason is--" here the     
Mock Turtle yawned and shut his eyes.   
"Tell
her about the reason and all     
that," he said to the Gryphon.

"The  
reason is," said the Gryphon, "that     
they _would_ go with the
lobsters to   
the dance. So they got thrown out to    
sea. So they had to
fall a long way.   
So they got their tails fast in their   
mouths. So they
couldn't get them out  
again. That's all."

"Thank you,"     
said Alice. "It's very interesting. I   
never knew so much
about a whiting     
before."

"I can tell you more than   
that, if you like," said the Gryphon.   
"Do you
know why it's called a whi-    
ting?"

"I never thought about it,"   
said Alice. "Why?"

"_It does the     
boots and shoes_," the Gryphon replied  
very solemnly.

Alice was thoroughly  
puzzled. "Does the boots and shoes!"    
she repeated
in a wondering tone-      
.

"Why, what are _your_ shoes done   
with?" said the Gryphon. "I mean, wha-  
t
makes them so shiny?"

Alice loo-  
ked down at them, and considered a      
little before she gave her
answer.     
"They're done with blacking, I believe- 
."

"Boots and shoes under the sea,"  
the Gryphon went on in a deep voi-      
ce,
"are done with whiting. Now you    
know."

"And what are they made of?"  
Alice asked in a tone of great curiosi- 
ty.

"Soles and eels, of course," the 
Gryphon replied rather impatie-         
ntly:
"any shrimp could have told you  
that."

"If I'd been the whiting,"    
said Alice, whose thoughts were still   
running
on the song, "I'd have said to 
the porpoise, 'Keep back, please:       
we
don't want _you_ with               
us!'"

"They were obliged to have him 
with them," the Mock Turtle said: "no-  

wise fish would go anywhere without a 
porpoise."

"Wouldn't it really?"     
said Alice in a tone of great surpri-   
se.

"Of course not," said the Mock   
Turtle: "why, if a fish came to _me_,   
and
told me he was going a journey, I  
should say, 'With what porpoise-
