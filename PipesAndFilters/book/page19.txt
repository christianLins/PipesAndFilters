 look-out for serpents night and day! Why, I
haven't had a wink of  
 sleep these three weeks!"

"I'm very sorry you've been annoyed,"  
 said Alice, who was beginning to
see its meaning.

"And just as I'd taken the highest tree in the wood," continued
  the
Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, "and just as I was thi- 
  nking I
should be free of them at last, they must needs come wri-  
 ggling down from
the sky! Ugh, Serpent!"

"But I'm _not_ a serpe- 
nt, I tell you!" said Alice. "I'm a---- I'm a
----"

"Well! _What_
 are you?" said the Pigeon. "I can see you're trying to
invent some-
thing!"

"I--I'm a little girl," said Alice, rather doubtfully, as 
   she remembered
the number of changes she had gone through that    
  day.

"A likely story indeed!" said the Pigeon in a tone of the   
 deepest
contempt. "I've seen a good many little girls in my time,  
but never
_one_ with such a neck as that! No, no! You're a serpent; 
 and there's no
use denying it. I suppose you'll be telling me next  
that you never
tasted an egg!"

"I _have_ tasted eggs, certainly,"
  said Alice, who was a very truthful
child; "but little girls eat  
 eggs quite as much as serpents do, you
know."

"I don't believe  
 it," said the Pigeon; "but if they do, why then
they're a kind of  
serpent, that's all I can say."

This was such a new idea to Alice,
 that she was quite silent for a
minute or two, which gave the Pige-
on the opportunity of adding, "You're
looking for eggs, I know _tha-
   t_ well enough; and what does it matter to
me whether you're a    
little girl or a serpent?"

"It matters a good deal to _me_," said 
Alice hastily; "but I'm not
looking for eggs, as it happens; and if 
 I was, I shouldn't want _yours_:
I don't like them raw."

"Well,  
 be off, then!" said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled
down  
  again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well   
as
she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branche-
 s, and
every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a  
 while she
remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in  
her hands, and
she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one
  and then at the
other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes  
  shorter, until she had
succeeded in bringing herself down to her   
usual height.

It was so long since she had been anything near the 
right size, that it
felt quite strange at first; but she got used to
 it in a few minutes,
and began talking to herself, as usual. "Come,
 there's half my plan done
now! How puzzling all these changes are! 
  I'm never sure what I'm going
to be, from one minute to another!   
 However, I've got back to my right
size: the next thing is, to get  
into that beautiful garden--how _is_
that to be done, I wonder?" As 
 she said this, she came suddenly upon an
open place, with a little  
  house in it about four feet high. "Whoever
lives there," thought   
Alice, "it'll never do to come upon them _this_
size: why, I should 
   frighten them out of their wits!" So she began
nibbling at the    
right-hand bit again, and did not venture to go near the
house till 
 she had brought herself down to nine inches high.

FOR a minute or two she stood
 looking at the house, and
wondering what to do next, when suddenly 
 a footman in livery came
running out of the wood--(she considered
