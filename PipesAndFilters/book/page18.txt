 speak again. In a
minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out
  of its mouth and
yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it  
 got down off the
mushroom, and crawled away into the grass, merely  
 remarking as it went,
"One side will make you grow taller, and the  
other side will make you
grow shorter."

"One side of _what_? The 
 other side of _what_?" thought Alice to
herself.

"Of the mushro- 
om," said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it
aloud; and in
  another moment it was out of sight.

Alice remained looking tho- 
  ughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying
to make out which   
 were the two sides of it; and as it was perfectly
round, she found  
 this a very difficult question. However, at last she
stretched her  
 arms round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit
of the  
 edge with each hand.

"And now which is which?" she said to herse- 
 lf, and nibbled a little of
the right-hand bit to try the effect:  
the next moment she felt a violent
blow underneath her chin: it had 
struck her foot!

[Illustration]

She was a good deal frightened 
 by this very sudden change, but she felt
that there was no time to  
be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she
set to work at once to
 eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed
so closely against 
 her foot that there was hardly room to open her
mouth; but she did  
    it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the
left-hand     
bit.

"Come, my head's 
 free at last!" said Alice in a tone of delight, which
changed into  
  alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders
were   
nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was
an
   immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of   
  a
sea of green leaves that lay far below her.

"What _can_ all   
 that green stuff be?" said Alice. "And where have my
shoulders got  
  to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I ca'n't see you?"
She was   
 moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow,
e- 
 xcept a little shaking among the distant green leaves.

As there  
seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head, she
tri-
   ed to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that    
 her
neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent.  
 She had
just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag,  
  and was going
to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be   
  nothing but the tops
of the trees under which she had been wande-  
ring, when a sharp hiss made
her draw back in a hurry: a large pige-
 on had flown into her face, and
was beating her violently with its  
 wings.

"Serpent!" screamed the Pigeon.

"I'm _not_ a serpent!"  
 said Alice indignantly. "Let me alone!"

"Serpent, I say again!"  
 repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued tone,
and added with a  
kind of a sob, "I've tried every way, and nothing seems
to suit the-
  m!"

"I haven't the least idea what you're talking about," said   
 Alice.

"I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and  
 I've tried
hedges," the Pigeon went on, without attending to her;  
 "but those
serpents! There's no pleasing them!"

Alice was more  
and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in
saying anythi-
  ng more till the Pigeon had finished.

"As if it wasn't trouble   
 enough hatching the eggs," said the Pigeon;
"but I must be on the
