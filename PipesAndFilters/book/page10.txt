  with one finger pressed upon its forehead
(the position in which  
you usually see Shakespeare, in the pictures of
him), while the rest
 waited in silence. At last the Dodo said
"_Everybody_ has won, and 
_all_ must have prizes."

"But who is to give the prizes?" quite a 
 chorus of voices asked.

"Why, _she_, of course," said the Dodo,  
 pointing to Alice with one
finger; and the whole party at once cro- 
    wded round her, calling out in a
confused way, "Prizes! Pri-    
  zes!"

Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her   
  hand in her
pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits (luckily the   
 salt water had not
got into it), and handed them round as prizes.  
 There was exactly one
apiece all round.

          _They all cro- 
  wded round it panting and asking,
          "But who has stratio-

"But she must have a prize herself, you know,"  
      said the Mouse.

"Of course," the Dodo replied very gra-      
vely.

"What else have you got in your pocket?" it went on, turning
  to Alice.

"Only a thimble," said Alice sadly.

"Hand it over  
 here," said the Dodo.

Then they all crowded round her once more,  
 while the Dodo solemnly
presented the thimble, saying "We beg your  
acceptance of this elegant
thimble;" and, when it had finished this 
short speech, they all cheered.

Alice thought the whole thing very
  absurd, but they all looked so grave
that she did not dare to lau- 
gh; and, as she could not think of anything
to say, she simply bowe-
d, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as she
could.

The next
 thing was to eat the comfits; this caused some noise and
confusion,
 as the large birds complained that they could not taste
theirs, and
 the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.
However, it
 was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and
begged the
 Mouse to tell them something more.

"You promised to tell me your 
 history, you know," said Alice, "and why
it is you hate--C and D,"  
 she added in a whisper, half afraid that it
would be offended aga- 
in.

"Mine is a long and sad tale!" said the Mou-
  se, turning to Alice and
sighing.

"It _is_ a long tail, certa-  
  inly," said Alice, looking down with wonder
at the Mouse's tail;   
"but why do you call it sad?" And she kept on
puzzling about it whi-
le the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the
tale was somethi-
 ng like this:--

          "Fury said to
              a mouse,  
 That
                  he met in the
                      house,  
              'Let
                        us both go
              
                                         to law: _I_
               
                                           will prose-
              
                                          cute _you_.--
            
                                           Come, I'll
              
                            take no de-
                         ni- 
al: We
                     must have
                 the trial;

                For really
             this morn-
           ing   
 I've
          nothing
           to do.'
            Said the
 
              mouse to
              the cur,
               'Such  
    a
                trial, dear
                  sir, With
