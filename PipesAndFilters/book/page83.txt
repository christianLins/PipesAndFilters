leaves that had fluttered down from  
the trees upon her face.

"Wake up,   
Alice dear!" said her sister. "Why,     
what a long sleep you've
had!"

"Oh, 
I've had such a curious dream!" said    
Alice, and she told her
sister, as     
well as she could remember them, all    
these strange Adventures
of hers that  
you have just been reading about; and   
when she had
finished, her sister      
kissed her, and said "It _was_ a curi-  
ous dream,
dear, certainly: but now    
run in to your tea; it's getting late." 
So
Alice got up and ran off, thinking  
while she ran, as well she              
might,
what a wonderful dream it had   
been.




BUT her sister sat still 
just as she had left her, leaning her   
head,
watching the setting sun, and    
thinking of little Alice and all nde-

that
_would_ always get into her eye-  
s--and still as she listened, or see-   
med
to listen, the whole place around  
her became alive with the strange
cre- 
atures of her little sister's dre-      
am.

The long grass rustled at her    
feet as the White Rabbit hurried 
fri- 
he
frightened Mouse splashed his way   
through the neighbouring pool--she
co- 
uld hear the rattle of the teacups as   
the March Hare and his friends
shared  
their never-ending meal, and the shrill 
voice of the Queen
ordering off her    
unfortunate guests to execution--once   
more the pig-baby
was sneezing on the  
Duchess' knee, while plates and dishes  
crashed
around it--once more the shri-
