of Hearts, he stole those tarts,
      
              And took them quite awa-  
y!"

"Consider your verdict," the     
King said to the jury.

"Not yet, not 
yet!" the Rabbit hastily interrupted.   
"There's a great
deal to come before   
that!"

"Call the first witness,"     
said the King; and the Rabbit blew      
three
blasts on the trumpet, and       
called out "First witness!"

The      
first witness was the Hatter. He came   
in with a teacup in one hand
and a     
piece of bread-and-butter in the other. 
"I beg pardon, your
Majesty," he       
began, "for bringing these in; but I    
hadn't quite finished
my tea when I    
was sent for."

"You ought to have    
finished," said the King. "When did you 
begin?"

The Hatter looked at the     
March Hare, who had followed him into   
the
court, arm-in-arm with the Dormo-  
use. "Fourteenth of March, I _think_    
it
was," he said.

"Fifteenth," said 
the March Hare.

"Sixteenth," said    
the Dormouse.

"Write that down," the 
King said to the jury, and the jury     
eagerly wrote
down all three dates on  
their slates, and then added them up,   
and
reduced the answer to shillings    
and pence.

"Take off your hat," the  
King said to the Hatter.

"It isn't   
mine," said the Hatter.

"_Stolen!_"  
the King exclaimed, turning to the      
jury, who instantly made
a memorandum  
of the fact.

"I keep them to sell,"  
the Hatter added as an explanation:     
"I've none of
my own. I'm a hatte-     
r."

Here the Queen put on her spe-   
ctacles, and began staring hard at the- 

Hatter, who turned pale and fidge-    
ted.

"Give your evidence," said the  
King; "and don't be nervous, or I'll    
have
you executed on the spo-          
t."

This did not seem to encourage   
the witness at all: he kept shifting    
from
one foot to the other, looking    
uneasily at the Queen, and in his
co-  
nfusion he bit a large piece out of his 
teacup instead of the
bread-and-bu-    
tter.

Just at this moment Alice felt
