 rpillar.

"Well, I've tried to say '_How doth the little busy bee- 
 _,' but it all
came different!" Alice replied in a very melancholy  
voice.

"Repeat '_You are old, Father William_,'" said the Caterpi-
 llar.

Alice folded her hands, and began:--

          "You are  
old, Father William," the young man said,
            "And your hair
  has become very white;
          And yet you incessantly stand on  
your head--
            Do you think, at your age, it is right?"


              "In my youth," Father William replied to his son,
    
            "I feared it might injure the brain;
          But, now 
that I'm perfectly sure I have none,
            Why, I do it again 
 and again."

          "You are old," said the youth, "as I menti- 
   oned before,
            And have grown most uncommonly fat;
   
              Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door--
    
             Pray, what is the reason of that?"

          "In my  
 youth," said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,
            "I  
 kept all my limbs very supple
          By the use of this ointme- 
 nt--one shilling the box--
            Allow me to sell you a cou- 
ple?"

          "You are old," said the youth, "and your jaws are 
too weak
            For anything tougher than suet;
          Yet 
       you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak--
       
             Pray, how did you manage to do it?"

          "In my  
 youth," said his father, "I took to the law
            And argued  
 each case with my wife;
          And the muscular strength, which  
 it gave to my jaw,
            Has lasted the rest of my life."

 
           "You are old," said the youth, "one would hardly suppose
 
             That your eye was as steady as ever;
          Yet you  
balanced an eel on the end of your nose--
            What made you 
 so awfully clever?"

          "I have answered three questions,  
 and that is enough,"
            Said his father; "don't give you- 
rself airs!
          Do you think I can listen all day to such stu-
 ff?
            Be off, or I'll kick you down stairs!"

"That is  
  not said right," said the Caterpillar.

"Not _quite_ right, I'm   
   afraid," said Alice, timidly; "some of the
words have got alte-   
 red."

"It is wrong from beginning to end," said the Caterpillar,  
 decidedly,
and there was silence for some minutes.

The Caterpi- 
  llar was the first to speak.

"What size do you want to be?" it   
asked.

"Oh, I'm not particular as to size," Alice hastily replied;
 "only one
doesn't like changing so often, you know."

"I _don't_ 
  know," said the Caterpillar.

Alice said nothing: she had never   
been so much contradicted in all her
life before, and she felt that 
 she was losing her temper.

"Are you content now?" said the Cate- 
rpillar.

"Well, I should like to be a _little_ larger, sir, if you
 wouldn't
mind," said Alice: "three inches is such a wretched height
  to be."

"It is a very good height indeed!" said the Caterpillar  
 angrily, rearing
itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three  
 inches high).

"But I'm not used to it!" pleaded poor Alice in a  
piteous tone. And she
thought to herself, "I wish the creatures wou-
 ldn't be so easily
offended!"

"You'll get used to it in time,"  
said the Caterpillar; and it put its
hookah into its mouth and began
 smoking again.

This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to
