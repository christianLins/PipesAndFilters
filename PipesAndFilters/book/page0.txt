          _'Tis two score years since CARROLL'S art,
  
             With topsy-turvy magic,
           Sent ALICE wondering
     through a part
             Half-comic and half-tragic._

    
           _Enchanting ALICE! Black-and-white
             Has made  
  your deeds perennial;
           And naught save "Chaos and old   
       Night"
             Can part you now from TENNIEL;_

       
           _But still you are a Type, and based
             In Tru- 
 th, like LEAR and HAMLET;
           And Types may be re-draped to  
 taste
             In cloth-of-gold or camlet._

          _Here  
  comes afresh Costumier, then;
             That Taste may gain a   
      wrinkle
           From him who drew with such deft pen
      
                         The rags of RIP VAN WINKLE!_

            
                                        _AUSTIN DOBSON._



     
          All in the golden afternoon
            Full leisurely we 
      glide;
          For both our oars, with little skill,
      
             By little arms are plied,
          While little hands  
     make vain pretence
            Our wanderings to guide.

     
          Ah, cruel Three! In such an hour,
            Beneath such
     dreamy weather,
          To beg a tale of breath too weak
    
            To stir the tiniest feather!
          Yet what can one 
poor voice avail
            Against three tongues together?

rio-
       Imperious Prima flashes forth
            Her edict "to begin
  it"--
          In gentler tone Secunda hopes
            "There  
  will be nonsense in it!"--
          While Tertia interrupts the   
 tale
            Not _more_ than once a minute.

          Anon,  
      to sudden silence won,
            In fancy they pursue
      
             The dream-child moving through a land
            Of    
 wonders wild and new,
          In friendly chat with bird or bea- 
st--
            And half believe it true.

          And ever, as
       the story drained
            The wells of fancy dry.
