  followed her back to the
croquet-ground.

The other guests had   
taken advantage of the Queen's absence, and were
resting in the sha-
de: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried
back to the game,
  the Queen merely remarking that a moment's delay would
cost them  
their lives.

[Illustration: _The Queen never left off quarrelling

 with her head!"_]

All the time they were playing the Queen never  
left off quarrelling with
the other players, and shouting "Off with 
  his head!" or "Off with her
head!" Those whom she sentenced were   
 taken into custody by the soldiers,
who of course had to leave off  
 being arches to do this, so that by the
end of half an hour or so  
there were no arches left, and all the
players, except the King, the
   Queen, and Alice, were in custody and
under sentence of executi-  
on.

Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Ali-
  ce, "Have
you seen the Mock Turtle yet?"

"No," said Alice. "I   
   don't even know what a Mock Turtle is."

"It's the thing Mock    
 Turtle Soup is made from," said the Queen.

"I never saw one, or  
heard of one," said Alice.

"Come on then," said the Queen, "and he
  shall tell you his history."

As they walked off together, Alice  
 heard the King say in a low voice, to
the company generally, "You  
are all pardoned." "Come, _that's_ a good
thing!" she said to herse-
 lf, for she had felt quite unhappy at the
number of executions the  
Queen had ordered.

They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast 
asleep in the sun. (If
you don't know what a Gryphon is, look at the
  picture.) "Up, lazy
thing!" said the Queen, "and take this young  
lady to see the Mock
Turtle, and to hear his history. I must go back
 and see after some
executions I have ordered," and she walked off, 
 leaving Alice alone
with the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the  
look of the creature, but
on the whole she thought it would be quite
  as safe to stay with it as to
go after that savage Queen: so she  
 waited.

The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched  
 the Queen till
she was out of sight: then it chuckled. "What fun!"  
 said the Gryphon,
half to itself, half to Alice.

"What _is_ the  
 fun?" said Alice.

"Why, _she_," said the Gryphon. "It's all her  
      fancy, that: they never
executes nobody, you know. Come       
on!"

"Everybody says 'come on!' here," thought Alice, as she went 
  slowly
after it: "I never was so ordered about in my life, neve-  
 r!"

They had not gone far before they saw the  
  Mock Turtle in the distance,
sitting sad and lonely on a little   
ledge of rock, and, as they came
nearer, Alice could hear him sighi-
ng as if his heart would break. She
pitied him deeply. "What is his 
 sorrow?" she asked the Gryphon, and the
Gryphon answered, very nea- 
   rly in the same words as before, "It's all
his fancy, that: he    
 hasn't got no sorrow, you know. Come on!"

So they went up to the  
 Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes
full of tears, but  
said nothing.

"This here young lady," said the Gryphon, "she wants
 to know your
history, she do."

"I'll tell it her," said the Mock
  Turtle in a deep, hollow tone; "sit
down, both of you, and don't  
  speak a word till I've finished."

So they sat down, and nobody   
 spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to
herself, "I don't see how
