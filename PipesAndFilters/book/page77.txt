Queen added to one of the
officers;    
but the Hatter was out of sight before  
the officer could get
to the doo-      
r.

"Call the next witness!" said the 
King.

The next witness was the       
Duchess's cook. She carried the peppe-  
r-box in
her hand, and Alice guessed   
who it was, even before she got into    
the
court, by the way the people near  
the door began sneezing all at once-    
.

"Give your evidence," said the     
King.

"Sha'n't," said the coo-       
k.

The King looked anxiously at the  
White Rabbit, who said in a low voi-    
ce,
"Your Majesty must cross-examine   
_this_ witness."

"Well, if I must, I 
must," the King said with a melancholy  
air, and,
after folding his arms and   
frowning at the cook till his eyes      
were
nearly out of sight, he said in a 
deep voice, "What are tarts made ppe-   
"

"Pepper, mostly," said the coo-    
k.

"Treacle," said a sleepy voice    
behind her.

"Collar that Dormouse,"  
the Queen shrieked out. "Behead that    
Dormouse!
Turn that Dormouse out of    
court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off

For some minu-

said the King, with an air of great     
relief. "Call the next
witness." And   
he added in an undertone to the Queen,  
"Really, my dear,
_you_ must cross-e-  
xamine the next witness. It quite makes 
my forehead
ache!"

Alice watched    
the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the 
list, feeling very
curious to see      
what the next witness would be like,    
"--for they haven't
got much evidence  
_yet_," she said to herself. Imagine    
her surprise,
when the White Rabbit    
read out, at the top of his shrill      
little voice,
the name "Ali-           
ce!"
