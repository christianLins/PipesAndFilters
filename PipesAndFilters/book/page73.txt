girls of her
age knew the meaning of   
it at all. However, "jurymen" would     
have done
just as well.

The twelve  
jurors were all writing very busily on  
slates. "What are they
all doing?"     
Alice whispered to the Gryphon. "They   
can't have anything to
put down yet,   
before the trial's begun."

[Illu-    
stration: _Who stole the                
tarts?_]

"They're putting down their 
names," the Gryphon whispered in        
reply,
"for fear they should forget    
them before the end of the tri-         
al."

"Stupid things!" Alice began in 
a loud, indignant voice, but she sto-   
pped
hastily, for the White Rabbit     
cried out "Silence in the court!" and   
the
King put on his spectacles and     
looked anxiously round, to see who lki- 

talking.

Alice could see, as well  
as if she were looking over their sho-  
ulders,
that all the jurors were wri-  
ting down "stupid things!" on their     
slates,
and she could even make out    
that one of them didn't know how to     
spell
"stupid," and that he had to ask 
his neighbour to tell him. "A nice-     

muddle their slates will be in before 
the trial's over!" thought Ali-         
ce.

One of the jurors had a pencil   
that squeaked. This, of course, Ali-    
ce
could _not_ stand, and she went     
round the court and got behind him,     
and
very soon found an opportunity of  
taking it away. She did it so qui-      
ckly
that the poor little juror (it    
was Bill, the Lizard) could not make    
out
at all what had become of it; so,  
after hunting all about for it, he
was 
obliged to write with one finger for    
the rest of the day; and this
was of   
very little use, as it left no mark on  
the slate.

"Herald, read the accu-   
sation!" said the King.

On this the  
White Rabbit blew three blasts on the   
trumpet, and then
unrolled the         
parchment scroll, and read as follo-    
ws:

          "The Queen of Hearts,  
she made some tarts,
              All 
on a summer day:
          The Knave
