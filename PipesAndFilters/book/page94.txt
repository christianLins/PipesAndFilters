ction 4.  Information about Donations   
to the Project Gutenberg
Literary      
Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbe-  
rg-tm depends upon and cannot survive   
without wide
spread public support and 
donations to carry out its mission      
of
increasing the number of public     
domain and licensed works that can      
be
freely distributed in machine rea-  
dable form accessible by the widest
a- 
rray of equipment including outdated    
equipment.  Many small donations
($1   
to $5,000) are particularly important   
to maintaining tax exempt
status with  
the IRS.

The Foundation is committed 
to complying with the laws regulati-    
ng
charities and charitable donations  
in all 50 states of the United
States. 
  Compliance requirements are not uni-  
form and it takes a
considerable effo- 
rt, much paperwork and many fees to     
meet and keep up
with these require-   
ments.  We do not solicit donations in  
locations
where we have not received   
written confirmation of compliance.     
  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the   
status of compliance for any
parti-    
cular state visit http://pglaf.o-       
rg

While we cannot and do not soli-  
cit contributions from states where     
we
have not met the solicitation requ- 
irements, we know of no prohibition
a- 
gainst accepting unsolicited donations  
from donors in such states who
appro-  
ach us with offers to donate.
