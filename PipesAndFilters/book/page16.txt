anything that
looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the 
 circumstances.
There was a large mushroom growing near her, about  
 the same height as
herself; and, when she had looked under it, and  
  on both sides of it, and
behind it, it occurred to her that she   
 might as well look and see what
was on the top of it.

She stre- 
 tched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the
mushro- 
om, and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue
caterpillar, 
that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly
smoking a 
long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of
anythi-
 ng else.




CHAPTER V


[Sidenote: _Advice from a Caterpi- 
  llar_]

THE Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some-  
  
time in silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of   
its
mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.

"Who are
 _you_?" said the Caterpillar.

This was not an encouraging opening
  for a conversation. Alice replied,
rather shyly, "I hardly know,  
sir, just at present--at least I know who
I _was_ when I got up this
  morning, but I think I must have been changed
several times since  
 then."

"What do you mean by that?" said the Caterpillar sternly.  
"Explain
yourself!"

"I can't explain _myself_, I'm afraid, sir," 
  said Alice, "because I'm
not myself, you see."

"I don't see,"   
 said the Caterpillar.

"I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly,"  
 Alice replied very politely,
"for I can't understand it myself to  
   begin with; and being so many
different sizes in a day is very    
 confusing."

"It isn't," said the Caterpillar.

"Well, perhaps  
you haven't found it so yet," said Alice, "but when you
have to turn
 into a chrysalis--you will some day, you know--and then
after that 
  into a butterfly, I should think you'll feel it a little
queer,   
 won't you?"

"Not a bit," said the Caterpillar.

"Well, perhaps  
your feelings may be different," said Alice; "all I know
is, it wou-
  ld feel very queer to _me_."

"You!" said the Caterpillar conte-  
 mptuously. "Who are _you_?"

Which brought them back again to the  
beginning of the conversation.
Alice felt a little irritated at the 
Caterpillar's making such _very_
short remarks, and she drew herself
 up and said, very gravely, "I think
you ought to tell me who _you_ 
are, first."

"Why?" said the Caterpillar.

[Illustration: _Advi-
ce from a Caterpillar_]

Here was another puzzling question; and as
  Alice could not think of any
good reason, and as the Caterpillar  
 seemed to be in a _very_
unpleasant state of mind, she turned awa- 
y.

"Come back!" the Caterpillar called after her. "I've something 
   important
to say!"

This sounded promising, certainly: Alice    
 turned and came back again.

"Keep your temper," said the Caterpi- 
llar.

"Is that all?" said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well
  as she
could.

"No," said the Caterpillar.

Alice thought she  
might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and
perhaps after
 all it might tell her something worth hearing. For some
minutes it 
puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded its
arms, took
  the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, "So you think
you're  
  changed, do you?"

"I'm afraid I am, sir," said Alice; "I can't   
 remember things as I
used--and I don't keep the same size for ten  
 minutes together!"

"Can't remember _what_ things?" said the Cate-
