 d.
Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one  
  arm out
of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to   
herself "Now I
can do no more, whatever happens. What _will_ become 
of me?"

Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its
  full effect,
and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomforta- 
ble, and, as there
seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getti-
  ng out of the room
again, no wonder she felt unhappy.

"It was   
much pleasanter at home," thought poor Alice, "when one wasn't
alwa-
 ys growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice bbi- 
   
rabbits. I almost wish I hadn't gone down that rabbit-hole--a-   
nd
yet--and yet--it's rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I
  do
wonder what _can_ have happened to me! When I used to read fai- 
ry-tales,
I fancied that kind of thing never happened, and now here 
 I am in the
middle of one! There ought to be a book written about  
 me, that there
ought! And when I grow up, I'll write one--but I'm  
 grown up now," she
added in a sorrowful tone; "at least there's no  
  room to grow up any more
_here_."

"But then," thought Alice,   
"shall I _never_ get any older than I am now?
That'll be a comfort, 
one way--never to be an old woman--but
then--always to have lessons 
 to learn! Oh, I shouldn't like _that_!"

"Oh, you foolish Alice!"  
 she answered herself. "How can you learn
lessons in here? Why, the- 
  re's hardly room for _you_, and no room at all
for any lesson-bo-  
oks!"

And so she went on, taking first one side and then the othe-
r, and making
quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few
 minutes she heard
a voice outside, and stopped to listen.

"Mary 
    Ann! Mary Ann!" said the voice. "Fetch me my gloves this mome-    
nt!"
Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew 
it was
the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she 
shook the
house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand 
  times as large
as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of   
 it.

Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open  
 it; but, as
the door opened inwards, and Alice's elbow was pressed  
 hard against it,
that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say  
to itself "Then I'll
go round and get in at the window."

"_That_ 
 you won't" thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied
she  
   heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out    
  her
hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of   
 anything,
but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of  
broken glass,
from which she concluded that it was just possible it 
had fallen into a
cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.

Next 
    came an angry voice--the Rabbit's--"Pat! Pat! Where are you?"     
 And
then a voice she had never heard before, "Sure then I'm here!  
 Digging
for apples, yer honour!"

"Digging for apples, indeed!"  
  said the Rabbit angrily. "Here! Come and
help me out of _this_!"   
 (Sounds of more broken glass.)

"Now tell me, Pat, what's that in  
 the window?"

"Sure, it's an arm, yer honour." (He pronounced it  
"arrum.")

"An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it 
fills the whole
window!"

"Sure, it does, yer honour? but it's an 
arm for all that."

"Well, it's got no business there, at any rate:
  go and take it away!"

There was a long silence after this, and
