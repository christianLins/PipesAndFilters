  See how eagerly the lobsters and  
the turtles all advance!
  They are    
waiting on the shingle--will you come   
and join the dance?
    Will you,      
won't you, will you, won't you, will    
you join the dance?
    Will you,      
won't you, will you, won't you, won't   
you join the dance?

  "You can rea-  
lly have no notion how delightful it    
will be,
  When they take us up and    
throw us, with the lobsters, out to     
sea!"
  But the snail replied: "Too    
far, too far!" and gave a look askance- 
--
  Said he thanked the whiting       
kindly, but he would not join the       
dance.
    Would not, could not, would 
not, could not, would not join the      
dance.
    Would not, could not, would 
not, could not, could not join the      
dance.

  "What matters it how far we 
go?" his scaly friend replied;

upon the other side.
  The further off 
from England the nearer is to France-   
--
  Then turn not pale, beloved sna-

    Will you, won't you, will you,      
won't you, will you join the dance?
   
    Will you, won't you, will you,      
won't you, won't you join the dance-    
?"

"Thank you, it's a very inte-     
resting dance to watch," said Alice,    
feeling
very glad that it was over at  
last: "and I do so like that curious    
song
about the whiting!"

"Oh, as to 
the whiting," said the Mock Turtle,     
"they--you've seen them,
of course-    
?"

"Yes," said Alice, "I've often    
seen them at dinn----" she checked
he- 
rself hastily.

"I don't know where   
Dinn may be," said the Mock Turtle,     
"but if you've
seen them so often, of  
course you know what they're like-      
."

"I believe so," Alice replied     
thoughtfully. "They have their tails    
in
their mouths--and they're all over  
crumbs."

"You're wrong about the     
crumbs," said the Mock Turtle: "crumbs  
would all
wash off in the sea. But     
they _have_ their tails in their mou-
