r.'"

"Only mustard isn't a bird,"    
Alice remarked.

"Right, as usual,"   
said the Duchess: "what a clear way you 
have of
putting things!"

"It's a    
mineral, I _think_," said Alice.

"Of 
course it is," said the Duchess, who    
seemed ready to agree to
everything    
that Alice said: "there's a large       
mustard-mine near here. And
the moral  
of that is--'The more there is of mine, 
the less there is of
yours.'"

"Oh,  
I know!" exclaimed Alice, who had not   
attended to this last remark.
"It's a  
vegetable. It doesn't look like one,    
but it is."

"I quite agree with you- 
," said the Duchess; "and the moral of  
that
is--'Be what you would seem to    
be'--or if you'd like it put more
si-  
mply--'Never imagine yourself not to be 
otherwise than what it might
appear    
to others that what you were or might   
have been was not otherwise
than what  
you had been would have appeared to     
them to be otherwise.'"

"I think I

as you say it."

"That's nothing to   
what I could say if I chose," the       
Duchess replied, in
a pleased tone-    
.

"Pray don't trouble yourself to    
say it any longer than that," sai-      
d
Alice.

"Oh, don't talk about tro- 
uble!" said the Duchess. "I make you a  
present
of everything I've said as     
yet."

"A cheap sort of present!"     
thought Alice. "I'm glad they don't     
give
birthday presents like that!" But 
she did not venture to say it out
lo-  
ud.

"Thinking again?" the Duchess    
asked with another dig of her sharp     
little
chin.

"I've a right to thi-  
nk," said Alice sharply, for she was    
beginning to
feel a little worri-      
ed.

"Just about as much right," said 
the Duchess, "as pigs have to fly;      
and
the m----"

But here, to Alice's 
great surprise, the Duchess's voice     
died away, even
in the middle of her   
favourite word "moral," and the arm
