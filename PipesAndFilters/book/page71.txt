          And concluded the banquet     
by----"

"What _is_ the use of repe-  
ating all that stuff," the Mock Turtle- 

interrupted, "if you don't explain it 
as you go on? It's by far the           
most
confusing thing _I_ ever hea-     
rd!"

"Yes, I think 
you'd better leave off," said the       
Gryphon: and Alice was
only too glad   
to do so.

"Shall we try another      
figure of the Lobster Quadrille?" the   
Gryphon went
on. "Or would you like    
the Mock Turtle to sing you another     
song?"

"Oh, a song, please, if the   
Mock Turtle would be so kind," Ali-     
ce
replied, so eagerly that the        
Gryphon said, in a rather offended      
tone,
"H'm! No accounting for tastes!  
Sing her '_Turtle Soup_,' will you,     
old
fellow?"

The Mock Turtle sighed 
deeply, and began, in a voice choked    
with sobs,
to sing this:--

         
          "Beautiful Soup, so rich and  
green,
          Waiting in a hot      
tureen!
          Who for such dainti- 
es would not stoop?
          Soup of  
the evening, beautiful Soup!
          
          Soup of the evening, beauti-  
ful Soup!
              Beau--ootiful  
Soo--oop!
              Beau--ootiful  
Soo--oop!
          Soo--oop of the    
e--e--evening,
              Beauti-   
ful, beautiful Soup!

          "Be-  
autiful Soup! Who cares for fish,
     
          Game, or any other dish?
    
          Who would not give all else   
for two
          Pennyworth only of   
beautiful Soup?
          Pennyworth   
only of beautiful Soup?
               
              Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
 
              Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
 
          Soo--oop of the e--e--eveni-  
ng,
              Beautiful, beauti-   
--FUL SOUP!"

"Chorus again!" cried   
the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had    
just begun
to repeat it, when a cry of 
"The trial's beginning!" was heard in   
the
distance.

"Come on!" cried the  
Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, 
it hurried
off, without waiting for
