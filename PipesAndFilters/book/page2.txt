 pictures or
conversations in it, "and what is the use of a book,"  
 thought Alice,
"without pictures or conversations?"

So she was  
 considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the
hot day  
made her feel very sleepy and stupid) whether the pleasure of
making
 a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and
picking 
 the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran
close  
 by her.

There was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did  
Alice think it
so _very_ much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say 
 to itself, "Oh
dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!" (when she tho- 
 ught it over
afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have  
wondered at this,
but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but 
when the Rabbit
actually _took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket_,
  and looked at it,
and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet,  
  for it flashed across
her mind that she had never before seen a   
rabbit with either a
waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it,
 and burning with
curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and 
 was just in time to
see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the  
  hedge.

In another moment down went Alice after it, never once   
considering how
in the world she was to get out again.

The rabbi-
t-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then
dipped 
 suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think
a- 
bout stopping herself before she found herself falling down what see-
med
to be a very deep well.

[Illustration]

Either the well was
  very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had
plenty of time as  
  she went down to look about her, and to wonder what
was going to   
happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out
what she was
 coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she
looked at 
 the sides of the well and noticed that they were filled with
cupbo- 
ards and book-shelves: here and there she saw maps and pictures
hung
  upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she
pa- 
 ssed; it was labelled "ORANGE MARMALADE," but to her disappointment  
  it
was empty; she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killi-  
 ng
somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the cupbo- 
   ards as
she fell past it.

"Well!" thought Alice to herself.    
 "After such a fall as this, I shall
think nothing of tumbling down  
stairs! How brave they'll all think me at
home! Why, I wouldn't say 
anything about it, even if I fell off the top
of the house!" (Which 
 was very likely true.)

Down, down, down. Would the fall _never_  
come to an end? "I wonder how
many miles I've fallen by this time?" 
she said aloud. "I must be getting
somewhere near the centre of the 
  earth. Let me see: that would be four
thousand miles down. I thi-  
nk--" (for, you see, Alice had learnt several
things of this sort in
   her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this
was not a _very_   
good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as
there was no one 
to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it
over) "--yes,
 that's about the right distance--but then I wonder what
Latitude or
  Longitude I've got to?" (Alice had no idea what Latitude
was, or  
   Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to
sa-   
  y.)

Presently she began again. "I wonder if I shall fall right   
_through_ the
earth! How funny it'll seem to come out among the peo-
