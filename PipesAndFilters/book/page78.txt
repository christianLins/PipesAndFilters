rry of
the moment how large she had    
grown in the last few minutes, and she- 

jumped up in such a hurry that she    
tipped over the jury-box with the
edge 
of her skirt, upsetting all the         
jurymen on to the heads of the
crowd   
below, and there they lay sprawling     
about, reminding her very much
of a    
globe of gold-fish she had accidentally 
upset the week before.

"Oh, I _beg_  
your pardon!" she exclaimed in a tone   
of great dismay, and
began picking     
them up again as quickly as she could,  
for the accident of
the gold-fish kept 
running in her head, and she had a      
vague sort of idea
that they must be   
collected at once and put back into the 
jury-box, or
they would die.

"The   
trial cannot proceed," said the King in 
a very grave voice, "until
all the     
jurymen are back in their proper pla-   
ces--_all_," he repeated
with great    
emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he   
said so.

Alice looked at the         
jury-box, and saw that, in her haste,   
she had put
the Lizard in head downwa-

waving its
tail about in a melancholy  
way, being quite unable to move. She    
soon got
it out again, and put it      
right; "not that it signifies much,"    
she said
to herself; "I should think   
it would be _quite_ as much use in the  
trial
one way up as the other."

As  
soon as the jury had a little recovered 
from the shock of being
upset, and     
their slates and pencils had been found 
and handed back to
them, they set to   
work very diligently to write out a     
history of the
accident, all except    
the Lizard, who seemed too much overco- 
me to do
anything but sit with its     
mouth open, gazing up into the roof of  
the
court.

"What do you know about  
this business?" the King said to Ali-   
ce.

"Nothing," said Alice.

"No-   
thing _whatever_?" persisted the        
King.

"Nothing whatever," said Ali-  
ce.

"That's very important," the     
King said, turning to the jury. They
