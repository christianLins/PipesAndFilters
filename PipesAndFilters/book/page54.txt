on, then!" roared the Queen, and Alice  
joined the procession,
wondering very  
much what would happen                  
next.

"It's--it's a very fine day!"  
said a timid voice at her side. She     
was
walking by the White Rabbit, who   
was peeping anxiously into her face-    
.

"Very," said Alice: "----where's   
the Duchess?"

"Hush! Hush!" said the 
Rabbit in a low hurried tone. He loo-   
ked anxiously
over his shoulder as he  
spoke, and then raised himself upon     
tiptoe, put
his mouth close to her     
ear, and whispered "She's under sente-  
nce of
execution."

"What for?" said 
Alice.

"Did you say 'What a          
pity!'?" the Rabbit asked.

"No, I    
didn't," said Alice: "I don't think     
it's at all a pity. I said
'What

"She boxed the Queen's

You see she came rather late, and the-  

Queen said----"

"Get to your pla-  
ces!" shouted the Queen in a voice of   
thunder, and
people began running abo- 
ut in all directions, tumbling up aga-  
inst each
other; however, they got     
settled down in a minute or two, and    
the game
began. Alice thought she had  
never seen such a curious croquet-gro-  
und in
all her life; it was all ridges 
and furrows; the balls were live
he-   
dgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes,   
and the soldiers had to double
themse- 
lves up and to stand upon their hands   
and feet, to make the
arche-           
s.

The chief       
difficulty Alice found at first was in  
managing her flamingo;
she succeeded   
in getting its body tucked away, comfo- 
rtably enough, under
her arm, with its 
legs hanging down, but generally, just  
as she had got
its neck nicely stra-   
ightened out, and was going to give the 
hedgehog a
blow with its head, it      
_would_ twist itself round and look up  
in her
face, with such a puzzled ssi-
