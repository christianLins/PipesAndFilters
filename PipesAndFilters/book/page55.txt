ression that she could not help bursti- 
ng
out laughing: and when she had got  
its head down, and was going to
begin  
again, it was very provoking to find    
that the hedgehog had
unrolled itself  
and was in the act of crawling away:    
besides all this,
there was generally  
a ridge or a furrow in the way wherever 
she wanted
to send the hedgehog to,    
and, as the doubled-up soldiers were    
always
getting up and walking off to   
other parts of the ground, Alice soon   
came
to the conclusion that it was a   
very difficult game indeed.

The pla- 
yers all played at once without waiting 
for turns, quarrelling
all the while,  
and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in  
a very short time
the Queen was in a   
furious passion, and went stamping abo- 
ut, and
shouting "Off with his head!"  
or "Off with her head!" about once in   
a
minute.

Alice began to feel very  
uneasy: to be sure she had not as yet   
had any
dispute with the Queen, but    
she knew that it might happen any minu-

"and then," thought she, "what     
would become of me? They're dreadfu-    
lly
fond of beheading people here: the 
great wonder is that there's any one-   

left alive!"

She was looking about 
for some way of escape, and wondering   
whether she
could get away without     
being seen, when she noticed a curi-    
ous
appearance in the air: it puzzled  
her very much at first, but, after
wa- 
tching it a minute or two, she made it  
out to be a grin, and she said
to      
herself "It's the Cheshire Cat: now I   
shall have somebody to talk
to-        
."

"How are you getting on?" said    
the Cat, as soon as there was mouth
e- 
nough for it to speak with.

Alice    
waited till the eyes appeared, and then 
nodded. "It's no use
speaking to it,"  
she thought, "till its ears have come,  
or at least one
of them." In another   
minute the whole head appeared, and     
then Alice put
down her flamingo, and  
began an account of the game, feeling   
very glad
she had some one to listen
