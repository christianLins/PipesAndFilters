it her," said the Mock Turtle in a dee- 
p, hollow tone; "sit
down, both of     
you, and don't speak a word till I've   
finished."

So they sat down, and     
nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice    
thought to
herself, "I don't see how   
he can _ever_ finish, if he doesn't     
begin."
But she waited pati-           
ently.

"Once," said the Mock Turtle  
at last, with a deep sigh, "I was a     
real
Turtle."

These words were      
followed by a very long silence, broken 
only by an
occasional exclamation of   
"Hjckrrh!" from the Gryphon, and the    
constant
heavy sobbing of the Mock     
Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting   
up and
saying "Thank you, sir, for     
your interesting story," but she could  
not
help thinking there _must_ be more 
to come, so she sat still and sai-      
d
nothing.

"When we were little,"   
the Mock Turtle went on at last, more   
calmly,
though still sobbing a little  
now and then, "we went to school in     
the
sea. The master was an old Turtle- 
--we used to call him Tortoise-         
----"

"Why did you call him Torto-   
ise, if he wasn't one?" Alice aske-     
d.

"We called him Tortoise because   
he taught us," said the Mock Turtle
a- 
ngrily: "really you are very            
dull!"

"You ought to be ashamed of   
yourself for asking such a simple que-  
stion,"
added the Gryphon; and then    
they both sat silent and looked at poo- 
r
Alice, who felt ready to sink into   
the earth. At last the Gryphon said
to 
the Mock Turtle, "Drive on, old fello-  
w. Don't be all day about it!"
and he  
went on in these words:

"Yes, we     
went to school in the sea, though you   
mayn't believe it----"

"I never said 
I didn't!" interrupted Alice.

"You   
did," said the Mock Turtle.

"Hold    
your tongue!" added the Gryphon, before 
Alice could speak again.
The Mock      
Turtle went on:--

"We had the best   
of educations--in fact, we went to      
school every
day----"

"_I've_ been  
to a day-school, too," said Alice; "you
