Section  2.  Information about the Mission of 
 Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the  
  free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the   
widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and
   new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of   
  volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Vo-  
 lunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assi- 
stance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
go-
 als and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
re- 
  main freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Pro-  
ject
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a 
  secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future   
  generations.

Archive Foundation
