 trees had a door
leading right into it. "That's very curious!" she  
thought. "But
everything's curious to-day. I think I may as well go 
in at once." And
in she went.

Once more she found herself in the 
  long hall, and close to the little
glass table. "Now I'll manage   
  better this time," she said to herself,
and began by taking the   
little golden key, and unlocking the door that
led into the garden. 
Then she set to work nibbling at the mushroom (she
had kept a piece 
of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot high:
then she walked
  down the little passage: and _then_--she found herself
at last in  
the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the
cool fou-
  ntains.




CHAPTER VIII


[Sidenote: _The Queen's Croque-  
t-Ground_]

A LARGE rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garde-
 n:
the roses growing on it were white, but there were three garde- 
  ners at
it, busily painting them red. Alice thought this a very   
 curious thing,
and she went nearer to watch them, and just as she  
came up to them she
heard one of them say "Look out now, Five! Don't
   go splashing paint over
me like that!"

"I couldn't help it,"   
  said Five, in a sulky tone. "Seven jogged my
elbow."

On which   
Seven looked up and said, "That's right, Five! Always lay the
blame 
  on others!"

"_You'd_ better not talk!" said Five. "I heard the   
  Queen say only
yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!"

"What   
 for?" said the one who had first spoken.

"That's none of _your_  
  business, Two!" said Seven.

"Yes, it _is_ his business!" said   
 Five. "And I'll tell him--it was for
bringing the cook tulip-roots  
instead of onions."

Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun
  "Well, of all the unjust
things----" when his eye chanced to fall  
   upon Alice, as she stood
watching them, and he checked himself    
   suddenly: the others looked round
also, and all of them bowed    
 low.

"Would you tell me," said Alice, a little timidly, "why you  
 are painting
those roses?"

Five and Seven said nothing, but loo- 
 ked at Two. Two began in a low
voice, "Why, the fact is, you see,  
 Miss, this here ought to have been a
_red_ rose-tree, and we put a  
  white one in by mistake; and if the Queen
was to find it out, we   
should all have our heads cut off, you know. So
you see, Miss, we're
 doing our best, afore she comes, to----" At this
moment, Five, who 
had been anxiously looking across the garden, called
out "The Queen!
 The Queen!" and the three gardeners instantly threw
themselves flat
  upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps,
and Alice  
  looked round, eager to see the Queen.

First came ten soldiers   
  carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the
three gardeners,   
oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the
corners: next the 
  ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with
diamonds, and   
walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came
the royal 
children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came
jumping 
merrily along hand in hand, in couples; they were all ornamented
wi-
  th hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and amo-  
 ng
them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a rvo- 
ried,
nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went 
by without
noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying
 the King's
crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and last of all this
