  nsider your verdict," the King said to the jury.

"Not yet, not   
yet!" the Rabbit hastily interrupted. "There's a great
deal to come 
  before that!"

"Call the first witness," said the King; and the   
   Rabbit blew three
blasts on the trumpet, and called out "First    
witness!"

The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a tea-
cup in one hand
and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. "I beg
   pardon, your
Majesty," he began, "for bringing these in; but I   
hadn't quite finished
my tea when I was sent for."

"You ought to 
 have finished," said the King. "When did you begin?"

The Hatter  
 looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the
court, n-a- 
-in-arm with the Dormouse. "Fourteenth of March, I _think_ it
was," 
 he said.

"Fifteenth," said the March Hare.

"Sixteenth," said  
 the Dormouse.

"Write that down," the King said to the jury, and  
  the jury eagerly wrote
down all three dates on their slates, and   
 then added them up, and
reduced the answer to shillings and pence- 
 .

"Take off your hat," the King said to the Hatter.

"It isn't  
mine," said the Hatter.

"_Stolen!_" the King exclaimed, turning to
  the jury, who instantly made
a memorandum of the fact.

"I keep  
them to sell," the Hatter added as an explanation: "I've none of
my 
  own. I'm a hatter."

Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and   
    began staring hard at the
Hatter, who turned pale and fidge-    
 ted.

"Give your evidence," said the King; "and don't be nervous,  
or I'll have
you executed on the spot."

This did not seem to ura-
  ourage the witness at all: he kept shifting from
one foot to the   
other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his
confusion he bit a 
    large piece out of his teacup instead of the
bread-and-butte-    
r.

Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which 
puzzled
her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was nni-
inning to
grow larger again, and she thought at first she would get 
up and leave
the court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain
   where she was as
long as there was room for her.

"I wish you   
  wouldn't squeeze so," said the Dormouse, who was sitting
next to   
 her. "I can hardly breathe."

"I can't help it," said Alice very  
meekly: "I'm growing."

"You've no right to grow _here_," said the 
Dormouse.

"Don't talk nonsense," said Alice more boldly: "you know
  you're growing
too."

"Yes, but _I_ grow at a reasonable pace,"  
 said the Dormouse; "not in
that ridiculous fashion." And he got up  
very sulkily and crossed over to
the other side of the court.

All
    this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter,    
and,
just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the 
officers
of the court, "Bring me the list of the singers in the last
  concert!" on
which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook  
off both his shoes.

"Give your evidence," the King repeated angri-
     ly, "or I'll have you
executed, whether you're nervous or      
 not."

"I'm a poor man, your Majesty," the Hatter began, in a tre- 
  mbling voice,
"--and I hadn't begun my tea--not above a week or   
so--and what with the
bread-and-butter getting so thin--and the twi-
    nkling of the tea----"

"The twinkling of _what_?" said the     
King.

"It _began_ with the tea," the Hatter replied.

"Of course
  twinkling _begins_ with a T!" said the King sharply. "Do you
take
