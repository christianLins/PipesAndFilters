cutioner myself," said the King eage-   
rly, and he
hurried off.

Alice tho- 
ught she might as well go back and see  
how the game was going
on, as she hea- 
rd the Queen's voice in the distance,   
screaming with
passion. She had alre-  
ady heard her sentence three of the     
players to be
executed for having      
missed their turns, and she did not     
like the look of
things at all, as the 
game was in such confusion that she     
never knew
whether it was her turn or  
not. So she went in search of her       
hedgehog.

The hedgehog was engaged   
in a fight with another hedgehog, which 
seemed
to Alice an excellent opportu-  
nity for croqueting one of them with    
the
other: the only difficulty was,    
that her flamingo was gone across to    
the
other side of the garden, where    
Alice could see it trying in a helple-  
ss
sort of way to fly up into one of   
the trees.

By the time she had cau-  
ght the flamingo and brought it back,   
the fight
was over, and both the       
hedgehogs were out of sight: "but it    
doesn't
matter much," thought Alice,   
"as all the arches are gone from this   
side
of the ground." So she tucked it  
under her arm, that it might not esca-  
pe
again, and went back for a little   
more conversation with her fri-         
end.

When she got back to the Che-   
shire Cat, she was surprised to find    
quite a
large crowd collected round    
it: there was a dispute going on betwe- 
en the
executioner, the King, and the  
Queen, who were all talking at once-    
,
while all the rest were quite sile-  
nt, and looked very uncomfortable-      
.

The moment Alice appeared, she was 
appealed to by all three to settle-     

the question, and they repeated their 
arguments to her, though, as they
all  
spoke at once, she found it very hard   
indeed to make out exactly
what they   
said.

The executi- 
oner's argument was, that you couldn't  
cut off a head unless
there was a body 
to cut it off from: that he had never
