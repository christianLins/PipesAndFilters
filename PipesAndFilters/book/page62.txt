together, Alice heard the King say in a 
low voice, to
the company generally,   
"You are all pardoned." "Come, _that's_ 
a good
thing!" she said to herself,    
for she had felt quite unhappy at the-  

number of executions the Queen had    
ordered.

They very soon came upon a  
Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun.  
(If
you don't know what a Gryphon is,  
look at the picture.) "Up, lazy
thi-   
ng!" said the Queen, "and take this     
young lady to see the Mock
Turtle, and 
to hear his history. I must go back     
and see after some
executions I have   
ordered," and she walked off, leaving   
Alice alone
with the Gryphon. Alice    
did not quite like the look of the cre- 
ature, but
on the whole she thought it 
would be quite as safe to stay with it  
as to
go after that savage Queen: so   
she waited.

The Gryphon sat up and   
rubbed its eyes: then it watched the    
Queen till
she was out of sight: then  
it chuckled. "What fun!" said the       
Gryphon,
half to itself, half to Ali-  
ce.

"What _is_ the fun?" said Ali-   
ce.

"Why, _she_," said the Gryphon.  
"It's all her fancy, that: they neve-   
r
executes nobody, you know. Come      
on!"

"Everybody says 'come on!'      
here," thought Alice, as she went slo-  
wly
after it: "I never was so ordered  
about in my life, never!"

They had not gone far before   
they saw the Mock Turtle in the dista-  
nce,
sitting sad and lonely on a       
little ledge of rock, and, as they are- 
e
nearer, Alice could hear him sighing 
as if his heart would break. She
pi-   
tied him deeply. "What is his sorrow?"  
she asked the Gryphon, and the
Gryphon 
answered, very nearly in the same       
words as before, "It's all
his fancy,  
that: he hasn't got no sorrow, you kno- 
w. Come on!"

So they went up to the  
Mock Turtle, who looked at them with    
large eyes
full of tears, but said     
nothing.

"This here young lady,"     
said the Gryphon, "she wants to know    
your
history, she do."

"I'll tell
