  sat down with her face in her hands,
wondering if anything would   
 _ever_ happen in a natural way again.

"I should like to have it  
explained," said the Mock Turtle.

"She ca'n't explain it," hastily
  said the Gryphon. "Go on with the next
verse."

"But about his  
toes?" the Mock Turtle persisted. "How _could_ he turn
them out with
 his nose, you know?"

"It's the first position in dancing," Alice 
 said; but was dreadfully
puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to  
change the subject.

"Go on with the next verse," the Gryphon repe-
ated: "it begins '_I passed
by his garden_.'"

Alice did not dare 
 to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come
wrong, and she  
 went on in a trembling voice:

          "I passed by his garden,  
and marked, with one eye,
          How the Owl and the Panther were
 sharing a pie:
          The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and
 meat,
          While the Owl had the dish as its share of the tre-
 at.
          When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,
 
          Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:
          While 
  the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,
          And   
concluded the banquet by----"

"What _is_ the use of repeating all 
 that stuff," the Mock Turtle
interrupted, "if you don't explain it  
  as you go on? It's by far the most
confusing thing _I_ ever hea-  
rd!"

"Yes, I think you'd better leave off," said
 the Gryphon: and Alice was
only too glad to do so.

"Shall we try
 another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?" the Gryphon went
on. "Or 
 would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you another song?"

"Oh, a  
 song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind," Alice
replied,  
 so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone,
"H'm!  
  No accounting for tastes! Sing her '_Turtle Soup_,' will you, llo-  
 
fellow?"

The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice  
 choked with sobs,
to sing this:--

          "Beautiful Soup, so  
 rich and green,
          Waiting in a hot tureen!
          Who  
 for such dainties would not stoop?
          Soup of the evening,  
beautiful Soup!
          Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!
oti-
            Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
              Beau--ootiful Soo- 
 --oop!
          Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,
              Be- 
autiful, beautiful Soup!

          "Beautiful Soup! Who cares for 
 fish,
          Game, or any other dish?
          Who would not  
give all else for two
          Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?

           Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?
              Beau--o- 
      otiful Soo--oop!
              Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
      
           Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,
              Beautiful,  
beauti--FUL SOUP!"

"Chorus again!" cried the Gryphon, and the Mock
 Turtle had just begun
to repeat it, when a cry of "The trial's nni-
inning!" was heard in the
distance.

"Come on!" cried the Gryphon,
 and, taking Alice by the hand, it hurried
off, without waiting for 
the end of the song.

"What trial is it?" Alice panted as she ran; 
 but the Gryphon only
answered "Come on!" and ran the faster, while  
more and more faintly
came, carried on the breeze that followed the-
m, the melancholy words:--

          "Soo--oop of the e--e--eveni-
ng,
              Beautiful, beautiful Soup!"
