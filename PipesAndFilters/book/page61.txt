that was linked
into hers began to     
tremble. Alice looked up, and there     
stood the Queen
in front of them, with 
her arms folded, frowning like a thu-   
nderstorm.

"A fine day, your Maje-   
sty!" the Duchess began in a low, weak  
voice.

"Now, I give you fair warni-  
ng," shouted the Queen, stamping on     
the
ground as she spoke; "either you   
or your head must be off, and that      
in
about half no time! Take your cho-  
ice!"

The Duchess took her choice,   
and was gone in a moment.

"Let's go  
on with the game," the Queen said to    
Alice; and Alice was too
much frighte- 
ned to say a word, but slowly followed  
her back to the
croquet-ground.

The 
other guests had taken advantage of     
the Queen's absence, and were
resting  
in the shade: however, the moment they  
saw her, they hurried
back to the      
game, the Queen merely remarking that a 
moment's delay would
cost them their   
lives.

All the time they were playing 
the Queen never left off quarrelling    
with
the other players, and shouting   
"Off with his head!" or "Off with       
her
head!" Those whom she sentenced    
were taken into custody by the soldi-   
ers,
who of course had to leave off    
being arches to do this, so that by     
the
end of half an hour or so there    
were no arches left, and all the
pla-  
yers, except the King, the Queen, and   
Alice, were in custody and
under       
sentence of execution.

Then the Que- 
en left off, quite out of breath, and   
said to Alice, "Have
you seen the Mock 
Turtle yet?"

"No," said Alice. "I    
don't even know what a Mock Turtle      
is."

"It's the thing Mock Turtle     
Soup is made from," said the Que-       
en.

"I never saw one, or heard of    
one," said Alice.

"Come on then,"    
said the Queen, "and he shall tell you  
his history."
