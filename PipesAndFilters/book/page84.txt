gs,
filled the air, mixed up with the  
distant sobs of the miserable Mock
Tu- 
rtle.

So she sat on with closed eye- 
s, and half believed herself in Wonde-  
rland,
though she knew she had but to  
open them again, and all would change   
to
dull reality--the grass would be    
only rustling in the wind, and the poo- 
l
rippling to the waving of the ree-   
ds--the rattling teacups would change-  

to the tinkling sheep-bells, and the  
Queen's shrill cries to the voice
of   
the shepherd boy--and the sneeze of the 
baby, the shriek of the
Gryphon, and   
all the other queer noises, would cha-  
nge (she knew) to the
confused clamour 
of the busy farm-yard--while the lowi-  
ng of the cattle
in the distance would 
take the place of the Mock Turtle's     
heavy sobs.

Lastly, she pictured to  
herself how this same little sister of  
hers
would, in the after-time, be      
herself a grown woman; and how she wou- 
ld
keep, through all her riper years,  
the simple and loving heart of          
her
childhood: and how she would       
gather about her other little childre-  
n,
and make _their_ eyes bright and    
eager with many a strange tale, perha-  
ps
even with the dream of Wonderland   
of long ago: and how she would fee-     
l
with all their simple sorrows, and   
find a pleasure in all their simple-    

joys, remembering her own child-life, 
and the happy summer days.
