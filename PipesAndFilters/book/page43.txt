    mind!" said the King, with an air of great relief. "Call the     
 next
witness." And he added in an undertone to the Queen, "Really,  
 my dear,
_you_ must cross-examine the next witness. It quite makes  
 my forehead
ache!"

Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled  
  over the list, feeling very
curious to see what the next witness   
  would be like, "--for they haven't
got much evidence _yet_," she   
 said to herself. Imagine her surprise,
when the White Rabbit read  
     out, at the top of his shrill little voice,
the name "Ali-     
     ce!"




CHAPTER XII


[Sidenote: _Alice's Evidence-     
  _]

"HERE!" cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of
the   
 moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she
ju- 
 mped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the- 
  
edge of her skirt, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of   
 the
crowd below, and there they lay sprawling about, reminding her  
  very much
of a globe of gold-fish she had accidentally upset the   
week before.

"Oh, I _beg_ your pardon!" she exclaimed in a tone of
   great dismay, and
began picking them up again as quickly as she   
 could, for the accident of
the gold-fish kept running in her head,  
and she had a vague sort of idea
that they must be collected at once
  and put back into the jury-box, or
they would die.

"The trial  
cannot proceed," said the King in a very grave voice, "until
all the
  jurymen are back in their proper places--_all_," he repeated
with  
great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said so.

Alice looked 
at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put
the Lizard 
  in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its
tail   
   about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move. She soon    
 got
it out again, and put it right; "not that it signifies much,"  
she said
to herself; "I should think it would be _quite_ as much use
 in the trial
one way up as the other."

As soon as the jury had a
  little recovered from the shock of being
upset, and their slates  
and pencils had been found and handed back to
them, they set to work
 very diligently to write out a history of the
accident, all except 
the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do
anything but sit with
  its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the
court.

"What do  
you know about this business?" the King said to Alice.

"Nothing," 
said Alice.

"Nothing _whatever_?" persisted the King.

"Nothing 
  whatever," said Alice.

"That's very important," the King said,   
turning to the jury. They were
just beginning to write this down on 
  their slates, when the White Rabbit
interrupted: "_Un_important,   
 your Majesty means, of course," he said in
a very respectful tone,  
but frowning and making faces at him as he
spoke.

"_Un_important,
 of course, I meant," the King hastily said, and went on
himself in 
an undertone,"important--unimportant--unimportant--important----"
as
 if he were trying which word sounded best.

Some of the jury wrote
 it down "important," and some "unimportant."
Alice could see this, 
 as she was near enough to look over their slates;
"but it doesn't  
 matter a bit," she thought to herself.

At this moment the King,  
 who had been for some time busily writing in
his note-book, called  
  out "Silence!" and read out from his book, "Rule
Forty-two. _All   
persons more than a mile high to leave the court._"

Everybody loo-
