                          'I'll be
                   judge,
      
                  I'll be

            cun-
          ning
           old
            Fury:
 
                'I'll
                try
                 the
   
                           whole
                   cause,
         
                              and

                      demn
              you to
            de-    
 ath.'

"You are not attending!" said the Mouse to Alice severely.  
"What are you
thinking of?"

"I beg your pardon," said Alice very 
humbly: "you had got to the fifth
bend, I think?"

"I had _not_!" 
 cried the Mouse, angrily.

"A knot!" said Alice, always ready to  
make herself useful, and looking
anxiously about her. "Oh, do let me
 help to undo it!"

"I shall do nothing of the sort," said the Mou-
se, getting up and walking
away. "You insult me by talking such nse-
  sense!"

"I didn't mean it!" pleaded poor Alice. "But you're so   
      easily offended,
you know!"

The Mouse only growled in       
  reply.

"Please come back and finish your story!" Alice called   
after it. And the
others all joined in chorus, "Yes, please do!" but
  the Mouse only shook
its head impatiently and walked a little qui- 
cker.

"What a pity it wouldn't stay!" sighed the Lory, as soon as 
 it was quite
out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of  
 saying to her
daughter, "Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you  
never to lose
_your_ temper!" "Hold your tongue, Ma!" said the young
 Crab, a little
snappishly. "You're enough to try the patience of an
  oyster!"

"I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!" said Alice  
    aloud, addressing
nobody in particular. "She'd soon fetch it     
back!"

"And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?"
  said the
Lory.

Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready  
 to talk about her pet:
"Dinah's our cat. And she's such a capital  
 one for catching mice, you
ca'n't think! And oh, I wish you could  
 see her after the birds! Why,
she'll eat a little bird as soon as  
 look at it!"

This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the  
 party. Some of the
birds hurried off at once; one old Magpie began  
   wrapping itself up very
carefully, remarking "I really must be    
 getting home; the night-air
doesn't suit my throat!" and a Canary  
 called out in a trembling voice to
its children "Come away, my dea- 
 rs! It's high time you were all in bed!"
On various pretexts they  
  all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.

"I wish I hadn't   
mentioned Dinah!" she said to herself in a melancholy
tone. "Nobody 
seems to like her, down here, and I'm sure she's the best
cat in the
   world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you
any   
more!" And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very
lo-
 nely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard  
a
little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked age-
 
eagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was  
coming
back to finish his story.




CHAPTER IV


[Sidenote:
   _The Rabbit sends in a Little Bill_]

IT was the White Rabbit,   
trotting slowly back again, and
looking anxiously about as it went, 
 as if it had lost something; and she
heard it muttering to itself,
