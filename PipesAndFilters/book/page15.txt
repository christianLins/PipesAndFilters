 they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her
head. "If I  
eat one of these cakes," she thought, "it's sure to make
_some_ cha-
 nge in my size; and, as it can't possibly make me larger, it
must  
 make me smaller, I suppose."

So she swallowed one of the cakes,  
and was delighted to find that she
began shrinking directly. As soon
 as she was small enough to get through
the door, she ran out of the
 house, and found quite a crowd of little
animals and birds waiting 
outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill, was in
the middle, being held
    up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it
something out of a    
 bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she
appeared; but  
 she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself
safe in a  
thick wood.

"The first thing I've got to do," said Alice to herse-
lf, as she wandered
about in the wood, "is to grow to my right size 
   again; and the second
thing is to find my way into that lovely    
 garden. I think that will be
the best plan."

It sounded an exce- 
llent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply
arranged; the only 
difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea
how to set about 
 it; and, while she was peering about anxiously among
the trees, a  
  little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a
great   
hurry.

An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round 
eyes, and
feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. "Poor 
little
thing!" said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to 
 whistle to
it; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the  
  thought that it
might be hungry, in which case it would be very   
likely to eat her up in
spite of all her coaxing.

Hardly knowing 
 what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and
held it out  
 to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off
all its  
 feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,
and  
 made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle- 
,
to keep herself from being run over; and, the moment she appeared 
  on the
other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and   
tumbled head
over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, 
 thinking it was
very like having a game of play with a cart-horse,  
and expecting every
moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round 
the thistle again; then
the puppy began a series of short charges at
  the stick, running a little
way forwards each time and a long way  
back, and barking hoarsely all the
while, till at last it sat down a
  good way off, panting, with its
tongue hanging out of its mouth,  
and its great eyes half shut.

This seemed to Alice a good opportu-
nity for making her escape; so she
set off at once, and ran till she
  was quite tired and out of breath, and
till the puppy's bark sou- 
  nded quite faint in the distance.

"And yet what a dear little   
puppy it was!" said Alice, as she leant
against a buttercup to rest 
 herself, and fanned herself with one of the
leaves. "I should have  
 liked teaching it tricks very much, if--if I'd
only been the right  
size to do it! Oh, dear! I'd nearly forgotten that
I've got to grow 
 up again! Let me see--how _is_ it to be managed? I
suppose I ought  
 to eat or drink something or other; but the great
question is, wha- 
t?"

The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round
  her at
the flowers and the blades of grass, but she could not see
