 cats."

"Not like cats!" cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate 
  voice. "Would
_you_ like cats if you were me?"

"Well, perhaps   
 not," said Alice in a soothing tone: "don't be angry
about it. And  
  yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you'd
take a   
   fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear qui-   
et
thing," Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about 
 in the
pool, "and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking  
her paws and
washing her face--and she is such a nice soft thing to 
 nurse--and she's
such a capital one for catching mice----oh, I beg  
  your pardon!" cried
Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bri-  
 stling all over, and she
felt certain it must be really offended.  
  "We won't talk about her any
more if you'd rather not."

"We,   
   indeed!" cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of    
his
tail. "As if _I_ would talk on such a subject! Our family always
 _hated_
cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't let me hear the name
 again!"

"I won't indeed!" 
said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of
conversation. 
 "Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?" The Mouse did not
answer, so  
  Alice went on eagerly: "There is such a nice little dog near
our   
 house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you- 
  
know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it'll fetch thi-  
 ngs
when you throw them, and it'll sit up and beg for its dinner,  
and all
sorts of things--I can't remember half of them--and it belo-
ngs to a
farmer, you know, and he says it's so useful, it's worth a 
 hundred
pounds! He says it kills all the rats and--oh dear!" cried  
Alice in a
sorrowful tone, "I'm afraid I've offended it again!" For 
  the Mouse was
swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and   
 making quite a
commotion in the pool as it went.

So she called  
softly after it, "Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we
won't talk 
about cats or dogs either, if you don't like them!"

When the Mouse
  heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her:
its face  
 was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a
low  
  trembling voice, "Let us get to the shore, and then I'll tell you   
    my
history, and you'll understand why it is I hate cats and     
dogs."

It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite cro-
wded with the
birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were 
 a Duck and a Dodo,
a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious  
 creatures. Alice led the
way, and the whole party swam to the sho- 
 re.




CHAPTER III


[Sidenote: _A Caucus-race and a Long  
   Tale_]

THEY were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled    
on
the bank--the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with the-
ir fur
clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and mfo-
 omfortable.

The first question of course was, how to get dry aga- 
 in: they had a
consultation about this, and after a few minutes it  
  seemed quite natural
to Alice to find herself talking familiarly   
 with them, as if she had
known them all her life. Indeed, she had  
 quite a long argument with the
Lory, who at last turned sulky, and  
  would only say, "I am older than
you, and must know better;" and   
 this Alice would not allow without
knowing how old it was, and, as  
the Lory positively refused to tell its
age, there was no more to be
