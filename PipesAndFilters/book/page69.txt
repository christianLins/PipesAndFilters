?'"

"Don't you mean 'purpose'?" said 
Alice.

"I mean what I say," the      
Mock Turtle replied in an offended      
tone. And
the Gryphon added, "Come,    
let's hear some of _your_ adventu-      
res."

[Illustration: _The Mock       
Turtle drew a long breath and said,     
"That's
very curious"_]

"I could    
tell you my adventures--beginning from  
this morning," said
Alice a little     
timidly: "but it's no use going back to 
yesterday,
because I was a different   
person then."

"Explain all that,"    
said the Mock Turtle.

"No, no! The   
adventures first," said the Gryphon in  
an impatient tone:
"explanations take  
such a dreadful time."

So Alice      
began telling them her adventures from  
the time when she first
saw the White  
Rabbit. She was a little nervous about  
it just at first,
the two creatures    
got so close to her, one on each side,  
and opened
their eyes and mouths so    
_very_ wide, but she gained courage as  
she went
on. Her listeners were perfe- 
ctly quiet till she got to the part     
about
her repeating "_You are old,     
Father William_," to the Caterpillar,   
and
the words all coming different,    
and then the Mock Turtle drew a         
long
breath, and said, "That's very    
curious."

"It's all about as curious 
as it can be," said the Grypho-         
n.

"It all came different!" the Mock 
Turtle repeated thoughtfully. "I
sho-  
uld like to hear her repeat something   
now. Tell her to begin." He
looked at  
the Gryphon as if he thought it had     
some kind of authority
over Ali-       
ce.

"Stand up and repeat '_'Tis the  
voice of the sluggard_,'" said the-     

Gryphon.

"How the creatures order  
one about, and make one repeat lesso-   
ns!"
thought Alice. "I might as well   
be at school at once." However, she     
got
up, and began to repeat it, but    
her head was so full of the Lobste-     
r
Quadrille, that she hardly knew what 
she was saying, and the words came-     

very queer indeed:--
