were
just beginning to write this down 
on their slates, when the White Rabbi-  
t
interrupted: "_Un_important, your    
Majesty means, of course," he said      
in
a very respectful tone, but frowni- 
ng and making faces at him as he
spo-  
ke.

"_Un_important, of course, I     
meant," the King hastily said, and went 
on
himself in an undertone,"importa-   
nt--unimportant--unimportant--importa-  
if he were trying which word sounded    
best.

Some of the jury wrote it down 
"important," and some "unimporta-       
nt."
Alice could see this, as she was  
near enough to look over their sla-     
tes;
"but it doesn't matter a bit,"    
she thought to herself.

At this      
moment the King, who had been for some  
time busily writing in
his note-book,  
called out "Silence!" and read out from 
his book, "Rule
Forty-two. _All        
persons more than a mile high to leave  
the court._"

Everybody looked at     
Alice.

"_I'm_ not a mile high," said 
Alice.

"You are," said the           
King.

"Nearly two miles high," added 
the Queen.

"Well, I sha'n't go, at   
any rate," said Alice: "besides, that's 
not a
regular rule: you invented it    
just now."

"It's the oldest rule in  
the book," said the King.

"Then it   
ought to be Number One," said Ali-      
ce.

The King turned pale, and shut   
his note-book hastily. "Consider you-   
r
verdict," he said to the jury, in a  
low trembling voice.

"There's more   
evidence to come yet, please your Maje- 
sty," said the White
Rabbit, jumping   
up in a great hurry: "this paper has    
just been picked
up."

"What's in    
it?" said the Queen.

"I haven't ope- 
ned it yet," said the White Rabbit,     
"but it seems to be a
letter, written  
by the prisoner to--to some-            
body."

"It must have been that,"     
said the King, "unless it was written   
to
nobody, which isn't usual, you kno- 
w."

"Who is it directed to?" said    
one of the jurymen.

"It isn't dire-  
cted at all," said the White Rabbit;
