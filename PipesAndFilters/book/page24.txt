  right," said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,
be-  
   ginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, whi-   
ch
remained some time after the rest of it had gone.

"Well! I've 
often seen a cat without a grin," thought Alice; "but a grin
without
     a cat! It's the most curious thing I ever saw in all my life-    
."

She had not gone much farther before she came
 in sight of the house of
the March Hare: she thought it must be the
   right house, because the
chimneys were shaped like ears and the   
 roof was thatched with fur. It
was so large a house, that she did  
not like to go nearer till she had
nibbled some more of the left-ha-
nd bit of mushroom, and raised herself,
to about two feet high: even
  then she walked up towards it rather
timidly, saying to herself,  
 "Suppose it should be raving mad after all!
I almost wish I'd gone  
 to see the Hatter instead!"




CHAPTER VII


[Sidenote: _A  
Mad Tea-party_]

THERE was a table set out under a tree in front of
 the
house, and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it:
 a
Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two
 were
using it as a cushion resting their elbows on it, and talking 
over its
head. "Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse," thought Alice;
 "only as
it's asleep, suppose it doesn't mind."

The table was a 
large one, but the three were all crowded together at
one corner of 
 it. "No room! No room!" they cried out when they saw Alice
coming.  
"There's _plenty_ of room!" said Alice indignantly, and she sat
down
  in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.

"Have some wine,"  
the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.

Alice looked all round
  the table, but there was nothing on it but tea.
"I don't see any  
   wine," she remarked.

"There isn't any," said the March Hare-   
   .

"Then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it," said Alice    
 angrily.

"It wasn't very civil of you to sit down without being  
   invited," said
the March Hare.

"I didn't know it was _your_    
   table," said Alice; "it's laid for a great
many more than thre-   
 e."

"Your hair wants cutting," said the Hatter. He had been loo- 
 king at Alice
for some time with great curiosity, and this was his  
  first speech.

"You should learn not to make personal remarks,"   
 Alice said with some
severity; "it's very rude."

The Hatter ope- 
 ned his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he _said_
was "Why  
  is a raven like a writing-desk?"

"Come, we shall have some fun   
  now!" thought Alice. "I'm glad they've
begun asking riddles.--I   
believe I can guess that," she added aloud.

"Do you mean that you 
   think you can find out the answer to it?" said
the March Hare-   
 .

"Exactly so," said Alice.

"Then you should say what you mea- 
  n," the March Hare went on.

"I do," Alice hastily replied; "at   
 least--at least I mean what I
say--that's the same thing, you kno- 
 w."

"Not the same thing a bit!" said the Hatter. "Why, you might  
just as
well say that 'I see what I eat' is the same thing as 'I eat
   what I
see'!"

"You might just as well say," added the March   
 Hare, "that 'I like what I
get' is the same thing as 'I get what I  
 like'!"

"You might just as well say," added the Dormouse, which  
seemed to be
talking in his sleep, "that 'I breathe when I sleep' is
  the same thing
as 'I sleep when I breathe'!"

"It _is_ the same
