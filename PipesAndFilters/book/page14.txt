Alice could only hear whispers
now and then; such as, "Sure, I don't
  like it, yer honour, at all, at
all!" "Do as I tell you, you cowa- 
  rd!" and at last she spread out her
hand again, and made another   
 snatch in the air. This time there were
_two_ little shrieks, and  
more sounds of broken glass. "What a number of
cucumber-frames there
   must be!" thought Alice. "I wonder what they'll do
next! As for   
pulling me out of the window, I only wish they _could_!
I'm sure _I_
 don't want to stay in here any longer!"

She waited for some time 
  without hearing anything more: at last came a
rumbling of little   
 cart-wheels, and the sound of a good many voices all
talking toge- 
  ther: she made out the words: "Where's the other
ladder?--Why I   
hadn't to bring but one; Bill's got the other--Bill!
Fetch it here, 
    lad!--Here, put 'em up at this corner--No, tie 'em
together     
 first--they don't reach half high enough yet--Oh! they'll do
well  
   enough; don't be particular--Here, Bill! catch hold of this
ro-   
   pe--Will the roof bear?--Mind that loose slate--Oh, it's coming    
  down!
Heads below!" (a loud crash)--"Now, who did that?--It was   
Bill, I
fancy--Who's to go down the chimney?--Nay, _I_ sha'n't! _Yo-
u_ do
it!--_That_ I won't, then! Bill's to go down--Here, Bill! the 
master
says you've to go down the chimney!"

"Oh! So Bill's got to
  come down the chimney, has he?" said Alice to
herself. "Why, they  
seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn't be in
Bill's place for 
 a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but
I _think_ I  
 can kick a little!"

She drew her foot as far down the chimney as  
 she could, and waited till
she heard a little animal (she couldn't  
 guess of what sort it was)
scratching and scrambling about in the  
chimney close above her: then,
saying to herself "This is Bill," she
      gave one sharp kick, and waited to
see what would happen      
  next.

The first thing she heard was a general chorus of "There   
 goes Bill!"
then the Rabbit's voice alone--"Catch him, you by the  
hedge!" then
silence, and then another confusion of voices--"Hold up
 his head--Brandy
now--Don't choke him--How was it, old fellow? What
  happened to you? Tell
us all about it!"

At last came a little  
 feeble, squeaking voice, ("That's Bill," thought
Alice,) "Well, I  
 hardly know--No more, thank ye; I'm better now--but I'm
a deal too  
 flustered to tell you--all I know is, something comes at me
like a  
 Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!"

"So you did,  
old fellow!" said the others.

"We must burn the house down!" said 
 the Rabbit's voice. And Alice
called out as loud as she could, "If  
  you do, I'll set Dinah at you!"

There was a dead silence insta-  
  ntly, and Alice thought to herself "I
wonder what they _will_ do   
  next! If they had any sense, they'd take the
roof off." After a   
  minute or two they began moving about again, and
Alice heard the   
 Rabbit say "A barrowful will do, to begin with."

"A barrowful of  
_what_?" thought Alice. But she had not long to doubt,
for the next 
 moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the
window,  
and some of them hit her in the face. "I'll put a stop to this,"
she
    said to herself, and shouted out "You'd better not do that aga-   
in!"
which produced another dead silence.

Alice noticed with some
   surprise that the pebbles were all turning into
little cakes as
