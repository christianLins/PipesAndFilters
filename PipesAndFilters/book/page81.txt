him to you,
             Though they   
were mine before.

           If I or 
she should chance to be
               
             Involved in this affair,
 
           He trusts to you to set them 
free,
             Exactly as we       
were.

           My notion was that  
you had been
             (Before she  
had this fit)
           An obstacle   
that came between
             Him,    
and ourselves, and it.

              
           Don't let him know she liked 
them best,
             For this must  
ever be
           A secret, kept      
from all the rest,
             Betwe- 
en yourself and me."

"That's the     
most important piece of evidence we've  
heard yet," said the
King, rubbing his 
hands; "so now let the                  
jury----"

"If any of them can expla- 
in it," said Alice, (she had grown so   
large in
the last few minutes that she 
wasn't a bit afraid of interrupting     
him,)
"I'll give him sixpence. _I_     
don't believe there's an atom of mea-   
ning in
it."

The jury all wrote     
down on their slates, "_She_ doesn't    
believe there's
an atom of meaning in  
it," but none of them attempted to      
explain the
paper.

"If there's no   
meaning in it," said the King, "that    
saves a world of
trouble, you know, as 
we needn't try to find any. And yet I   
don't
know," he went on, spreading out 
the verses on his knee, and looking     
at
them with one eye; "I seem to see   
some meaning in them after              
all.
'----_said I could not swim_--'   
you can't swim can you?" he added,
tu- 
rning to the Knave.

The Knave shook  
his head sadly. "Do I look like it?" he 
said. (Which he
certainly did _not_,   
being made entirely of cardbo-          
ard.)

"All right, so far," said the  
King, as he went on muttering over the- 

verses to himself: "'_We know it to   
be true_--' that's the jury, of
co-    
urse--'_If she should push the matter   
on_'--that must be the
Queen--'_What   
would become of you?_'--What, inde-
