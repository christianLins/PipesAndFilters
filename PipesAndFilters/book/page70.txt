          "'Tis the voice of the        
Lobster; I heard him declare,
         
          'You have baked me too brown, 
I must sugar my hair.'
          As a  
duck with its eyelids, so he with his   
nose
          Trims his belt and his  
buttons, and turns out his toes.
      
          When the sands are all dry,   
he is gay as a lark,
          And     
will talk in contemptuous tones of the  
Shark:
          But, when the tide    
rises and sharks are around,
          
          His voice has a timid and     
tremulous sound."

"That's different  
from what _I_ used to say when I was a  
child," said
the Gryphon.

"Well,    
_I_ never heard it before," said the    
Mock Turtle: "but it sounds
uncommon   
nonsense."

Alice said nothing; she   
had sat down with her face in her nde-  
ds,
wondering if anything would _ever_ 
happen in a natural way again.

"I    
should like to have it explained," said 
the Mock Turtle.

"She ca'n't expla-  
in it," hastily said the Gryphon. "Go   
on with the next
verse."

"But about 
his toes?" the Mock Turtle persisted.   
"How _could_ he turn
them out with his 
nose, you know?"

"It's the first     
position in dancing," Alice said; but   
was dreadfully
puzzled by the whole    
thing, and longed to change the subje-  
ct.

"Go on with the next verse," the 
Gryphon repeated: "it begins '_I        
passed
by his garden_.'"

Alice did  
not dare to disobey, though she felt    
sure it would all come
wrong, and she  
went on in a trembling voice:

       
          "I passed by his garden, and  
marked, with one eye,
          How    
the Owl and the Panther were sharing a  
pie:
          The Panther took pie-   
-crust, and gravy, and meat,
          
          While the Owl had the dish as 
its share of the treat.
               
          When the pie was all finishe- 
d, the Owl, as a boon,
          Was   
kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:
 
          While the Panther received    
knife and fork with a growl,
