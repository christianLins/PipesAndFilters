ed!--'_I gave her one,
they gave him   
two_--' why, that must be what he did   
with the tarts, you
know----"

"But  
it goes on '_they all returned from him 
to you_,'" said Alice.

"Why, there   
they are!" said the King triumphantly,  
pointing to the tarts
on the table.    
"Nothing can be clearer than _that_.    
Then again--'_before
she had this      
fit_--' you never had _fits_, my dear,  
I think?" he said to
the Que-          
en.

"Never!" said the Queen furi-    
ously, throwing an inkstand at the      
Lizard
as she spoke. (The unfortunate  
little Bill had left off writing on     
his
slate with one finger, as he found 
it made no mark; but he now hasti-      
ly
began again, using the ink, that    
was trickling down his face, as long    
as
it lasted.)

"Then the words      
don't _fit_ you," said the King, loo-   
king round the court
with a smile.     
There was a dead silence.

"It's a

and everybody laughed.

"Let the jury

twentieth time that   
day.

"No, no!" said the Queen. "Se-  
ntence first--verdict afterwa-          
rds."

"Stuff and nonsense!" said     
Alice loudly. "The idea of having the-  

sentence first!"

"Hold your tongu- 
e!" said the Queen, turning purple-     
.

"I won't!" said Alice.

"Off     
with her head!" the Queen shouted at    
the top of her voice. Nobody
mo-       
ved.

"Who cares for _you_?" said     
Alice (she had grown to her full size   
by
this time). "You're nothing but a   
pack of cards!"

At this the whole pack rose up 
into the air, and came flying down      
upon
her: she gave a little scream,    
half of fright and half of anger,       
and
tried to beat them off, and found  
herself lying on the bank, with         
her
head in the lap of her sister, who 
was gently brushing away some dea-
