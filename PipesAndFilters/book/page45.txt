all the rest,
             Between yourself and me."

"That's the 
 most important piece of evidence we've heard yet," said the
King,  
 rubbing his hands; "so now let the jury----"

"If any of them can  
  explain it," said Alice, (she had grown so large in
the last few   
  minutes that she wasn't a bit afraid of interrupting him,)
"I'll   
   give him sixpence. _I_ don't believe there's an atom of meaning    
 in
it."

The jury all wrote down on their slates, "_She_ doesn't  
  believe there's
an atom of meaning in it," but none of them atte-  
 mpted to explain the
paper.

"If there's no meaning in it," said  
 the King, "that saves a world of
trouble, you know, as we needn't  
 try to find any. And yet I don't
know," he went on, spreading out  
the verses on his knee, and looking at
them with one eye; "I seem to
 see some meaning in them after all.
'----_said I could not swim_--'
   you can't swim can you?" he added,
turning to the Knave.

The   
Knave shook his head sadly. "Do I look like it?" he said. (Which rta-
  
certainly did _not_, being made entirely of cardboard.)

"All   
 right, so far," said the King, as he went on muttering over the
ve- 
 rses to himself: "'_We know it to be true_--' that's the jury, urse- 
 course--'_If she should push the matter on_'--that must be the
Qu- 
 een--'_What would become of you?_'--What, indeed!--'_I gave her one- 
   ,
they gave him two_--' why, that must be what he did with the    
tarts, you
know----"

"But it goes on '_they all returned from him
  to you_,'" said Alice.

"Why, there they are!" said the King tri- 
 umphantly, pointing to the tarts
on the table. "Nothing can be cle- 
  arer than _that_. Then again--'_before
she had this fit_--' you   
 never had _fits_, my dear, I think?" he said to
the Queen.

"Ne- 
  ver!" said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Liza-  
 rd
as she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing  
 on his
slate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he  
now hastily
began again, using the ink, that was trickling down his 
 face, as long as
it lasted.)

"Then the words don't _fit_ you,"  
  said the King, looking round the court
with a smile. There was a   
 dead silence.

"It's a pun!" the King added in an angry tone, and  
everybody laughed.

"Let the jury consider their verdict," the King
 said, for about the
twentieth time that day.

"No, no!" said the 
Queen. "Sentence first--verdict afterwards."

"Stuff and nonsense!"
 said Alice loudly. "The idea of having the
sentence first!"

"Ho-
 ld your tongue!" said the Queen, turning purple.

"I won't!" said  
 Alice.

"Off with her head!" the Queen shouted at the top of her  
 voice. Nobody
moved.

"Who cares for _you_?" said Alice (she had  
grown to her full size by
this time). "You're nothing but a pack of 
 cards!"

At this the whole pack rose 
 up into the air, and came flying down upon
her: she gave a little  
  scream, half of fright and half of anger, and
tried to beat them   
 off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her
head in the lap  
 of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead
leaves that  
 had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.

"Wake up, Alice  
dear!" said her sister. "Why, what a long sleep you've
had!"

"Oh,
 I've had such a curious dream!" said Alice, and she told her
siste-
