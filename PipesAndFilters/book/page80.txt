"in fact, there's
nothing written on   
the _outside_." He unfolded the paper   
as he spoke,
and added "It isn't a     
letter after all: it's a set of verse-  
s."

"Are they in the prisoner's      
handwriting?" asked another of the      
jurymen.

"No, they're not," said the 
White Rabbit, "and that's the queerest  
thing
about it." (The jury all looked  
puzzled.)

"He must have imitated     
somebody else's hand," said the King.   
(The jury
all brightened up aga-       
in.)

"Please your Majesty," said the 
Knave, "I didn't write it, and the-     
y
can't prove that I did: there's no   
name signed at the end."

"If you     
didn't sign it," said the King, "that   
only makes the matter
worse. You _mu-  
st_ have meant some mischief, or else   
you'd have signed
your name like an    
honest man."

There was a general     
clapping of hands at this: it was the   
first really
clever thing the King had 
said that day.

"That _proves_ his    
guilt, of course," said the Queen: "so, 
off with----"

"It doesn't prove      
anything of the sort!" said Alice.      
"Why, you don't
even know what they're 
about!"

"Read them," said the        
King.

The White Rabbit put on his    
spectacles. "Where shall I begin, ple-  
ase
your Majesty?" he asked.

"Begin 
at the beginning," the King said gra-   
vely, "and go on till you
come to the  
end; then stop."

There was dead      
silence in the court, whilst the White  
Rabbit read out
these verses:--

    
          "They told me you had been to 
her,
             And mentioned me to  
him:
           She gave me a good     
character,
             But said I     
could not swim.

           He sent   
them word I had not gone,
             
             (We know it to be true):
 
           If she should push the       
matter on,
             What would     
become of you?

           I gave her 
one, they gave him two,
               
             You gave us three or more- 
;
           They all returned from
