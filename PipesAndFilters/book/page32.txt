going on between the
executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were 
 all talking at once,
while all the rest were quite silent, and loo- 
 ked very uncomfortable.

The moment Alice appeared, she was appe- 
aled to by all three to settle
the question, and they repeated their
  arguments to her, though, as they
all spoke at once, she found it  
 very hard indeed to make out exactly
what they said.

[Illustra- 
tion]

The executioner's argument was, that you couldn't cut off a 
 head unless
there was a body to cut it off from: that he had never  
had to do such a
thing before, and he wasn't going to begin at _his_
  time of life.

The King's argument was, that anything that had a  
   head could be
beheaded, and that you weren't to talk nonsense-   
.

The Queen's argument was, that if something wasn't done about it
 in less
than no time, she'd have everybody executed all round. (It 
was this last
remark that had made the whole party look so grave and
  anxious.)

Alice could think of nothing else to say but "It belo- 
 ngs to the Duchess:
you'd better ask _her_ about it."

"She's in  
 prison," the Queen said to the executioner; "fetch her here."
And  
the executioner went off like an arrow.

The Cat's head began fadi-
  ng away the moment he was gone, and by the time
he had come back   
 with the Duchess, it had entirely disappeared; so the
King and the  
executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it, while
the rest of
 the party went back to the game.




CHAPTER IX


[Sidenote:
 _The Mock Turtle's Story_]

"YOU can't think how glad I am to see 
you again, you
dear old thing!" said the Duchess, as she tucked her 
    arm affectionately
into Alice's, and they walked off togethe-    
r.

Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and 
thought
to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made
 her so
savage when they met in the kitchen.

"When _I'm_ a Duche-
  ss," she said to herself (not in a very hopeful tone
though), "I   
 won't have any pepper in my kitchen _at all_. Soup does very
well  
    without--Maybe it's always pepper that makes people hot-tempe-    
red,"
she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new kind 
of rule,
"and vinegar that makes them sour--and camomile that makes 
  them
bitter--and--barley-sugar and such things that make childre-  
n
sweet-tempered. I only wish people knew _that_: then they wouldn't
 be
so stingy about it, you know----"

She had quite forgotten the
 Duchess by this time, and was a little
startled when she heard her 
 voice close to her ear. "You're thinking
about something, my dear,  
 and that makes you forget to talk. I can't
tell you just now what  
the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in
a bit."

"Perhaps
 it hasn't one," Alice ventured to remark.

"Tut, tut, child!" said
 the Duchess. "Every thing's got a moral, if only
you can find it." 
   And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice's side as
she spo-   
 ke.

Alice did not much like her keeping so close to her: first,  
 because the
Duchess was _very_ ugly; and secondly, because she was  
 exactly the right
height to rest her chin on Alice's shoulder, and  
it was an uncomfortably
sharp chin. However, she did not like to be 
  rude, so she bore it as well
as she could. "The game's going on   
rather better now," she said, by way
of keeping up the conversation 
  a little.

"'Tis so," said the Duchess: "and the moral of that
