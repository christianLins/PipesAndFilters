lobsters, you know. Which shall sing?"

"Oh, _you_ sing," said the 
Gryphon. "I've forgotten the words."

So they began solemnly danci-
 ng round and round Alice, every now and then
treading on her toes  
 when they passed too close, and waving their
forepaws to mark the  
 time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly
and sadly:--

 
     "Will you walk a little faster?" said a whiting to a snail,
   
   "There's a porpoise close behind us, and he's treading on my tai- 
  l.
  See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!
  
   They are waiting on the shingle--will you come and join the dance- 
 ?
    Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the  
dance?
    Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join 
the dance?

  "You can really have no notion how delightful it will
 be,
  When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to 
 sea!"
  But the snail replied: "Too far, too far!" and gave a look  
  askance--
  Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not   
join the dance.
    Would not, could not, would not, could not, wou-
 ld not join the dance.
    Would not, could not, would not, could  
not, could not join the dance.

  "What matters it how far we go?" 
his scaly friend replied;
  "There is another shore, you know, upon 
the other side.
  The further off from England the nearer is to Fra-
  nce--
  Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the   
 dance.
    Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join  
 the dance?
    Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you  
  join the dance?"

"Thank you, it's a very interesting dance to   
watch," said Alice, feeling
very glad that it was over at last: "and
  I do so like that curious song
about the whiting!"

"Oh, as to  
the whiting," said the Mock Turtle, "they--you've seen them,
of cou-
 rse?"

"Yes," said Alice, "I've often seen them at dinn----" she  
 checked
herself hastily.

"I don't know where Dinn may be," said  
 the Mock Turtle, "but if you've
seen them so often, of course you  
 know what they're like."

"I believe so," Alice replied thoughtfu- 
 lly. "They have their tails in
their mouths--and they're all over  
 crumbs."

"You're wrong about the crumbs," said the Mock Turtle:  
 "crumbs would all
wash off in the sea. But they _have_ their tails  
 in their mouths; and
the reason is--" here the Mock Turtle yawned  
and shut his eyes. "Tell
her about the reason and all that," he said
   to the Gryphon.

"The reason is," said the Gryphon, "that they   
_would_ go with the
lobsters to the dance. So they got thrown out to
  sea. So they had to
fall a long way. So they got their tails fast  
    in their mouths. So they
couldn't get them out again. That's     
  all."

"Thank you," said Alice. "It's very interesting. I never   
 knew so much
about a whiting before."

"I can tell you more than  
that, if you like," said the Gryphon. "Do you
know why it's called a
 whiting?"

"I never thought about it," said Alice. "Why?"

"_It 
      does the boots and shoes_," the Gryphon replied very sole-      
 mnly.

Alice was thoroughly puzzled. "Does the boots and shoes!"  
  she repeated
in a wondering tone.

"Why, what are _your_ shoes   
   done with?" said the Gryphon. "I mean, what
makes them so shi-   
ny?"

Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she
 gave her
answer. "They're done with blacking, I believe."

"Boots
