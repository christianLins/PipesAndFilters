  m----" when she
was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat   
sitting on a bough of a
tree a few yards off.

[Illustration: _It 
  grunted again so violently that she looked down into
its face in   
  some alarm_]

The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked   
good-natured, she
thought: still it had _very_ long claws and a gre-
 at many teeth, so she
felt that it ought to be treated with respe- 
ct.

[Illustration]

"Cheshire Puss," she began, rather timidly, 
as she did not at all know
whether it would like the name: however, 
it only grinned a little wider.
"Come, it's pleased so far," thought
   Alice, and she went on. "Would you
tell me, please, which way I   
  ought to go from here?"

"That depends a good deal on where you   
want to get to," said the Cat.

"I don't much care where----" said 
    Alice.

"Then it doesn't matter which way you go," said the     
Cat.

"---- so long as I get _somewhere_," Alice added as an expla-
 nation.

"Oh, you're sure to do that," said the Cat, "if you only  
 walk long
enough."

Alice felt that this could not be denied, so  
  she tried another question.
"What sort of people live about here-  
 ?"

"In _that_ direction," the Cat said, waving its right paw rou- 
nd, "lives
a Hatter: and in _that_ direction," waving the other paw,
      "lives a March
Hare. Visit either you like: they're both      
  mad."

"But I don't want to go among mad people," Alice remarke-  
d.

"Oh, you ca'n't help that," said the Cat: "we're all mad here. 
    I'm mad.
You're mad."

"How do you know I'm mad?" said Ali-    
 ce.

"You must be," said the Cat, "or you wouldn't have come here- 
."

Alice didn't think that proved it at all; however, she went on.
 "And how
do you know that you're mad?"

"To begin with," said the
 Cat, "a dog's not mad. You grant that?"

"I suppose so," said Ali-
ce.

"Well, then," the Cat went on, "you see a dog growls when it's
 angry,
and wags its tail when it's pleased. Now _I_ growl when I'm 
pleased, and
wag my tail when I'm angry. Therefore I'm mad."

"_I_
   call it purring, not growling," said Alice.

"Call it what you   
   like," said the Cat. "Do you play croquet with the
Queen to-da-   
y?"

"I should like it very much," said Alice, "but I haven't been 
  invited
yet."

"You'll see me there," said the Cat and vanishe-  
 d.

Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used  
to queer
things happening. While she was looking at the place where 
it had been,
it suddenly appeared again.

"By-the-bye, what became
  of the baby?" said the Cat. "I'd nearly
forgotten to ask."

"It  
   turned into a pig," Alice quietly said, just as if it had come    
 back
in a natural way.

"I thought it would," said the Cat, and  
 vanished again.

Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it  
 again, but it did not
appear, and after a minute or two she walked  
on in the direction in
which the March Hare was said to live. "I've 
 seen hatters before," she
said to herself; "the March Hare will be  
 much the most interesting, and
perhaps as this is May, it won't be  
  raving mad--at least not so mad as
it was in March." As she said   
  this, she looked up, and there was the Cat
again, sitting on the   
 branch of a tree.

"Did you say pig, or fig?" said the Cat.

"I  
  said pig," replied Alice; "and I wish you wouldn't keep appearing   
   and
vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy."

"All
