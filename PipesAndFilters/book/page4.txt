uld be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I cou-
ld
shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to 
  begin."
For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened   
 lately, that
Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed  
 were really
impossible.

There seemed to be no use in waiting by  
  the little door, so she went
back to the table, half hoping she   
  might find another key on it, or at
any rate a book of rules for   
  shutting people up like telescopes: this
time she found a little   
 bottle on it ("which certainly was not here
before," said Alice,)  
 and tied round the neck of the bottle was a paper
label, with the  
 words "DRINK ME" beautifully printed on it in large
letters.

It  
   was all very well to say "Drink me," but the wise little Alice    
 was
not going to do _that_ in a hurry. "No, I'll look first," she  
 said, "and
see whether it's marked '_poison_' or not;" for she had  
 read several
nice little stories about children who had got burnt,  
 and eaten up by
wild beasts, and other unpleasant things, all beca- 
  use they _would_ not
remember the simple rules their friends had   
taught them: such as, that a
red-hot poker will burn you if you hold
 it too long; and that, if you
cut your finger _very_ deeply with a 
 knife, it usually bleeds; and she
had never forgotten that, if you  
 drink much from a bottle marked
"poison," it is almost certain to  
disagree with you, sooner or later.

However, this bottle was _not_
 marked "poison," so Alice ventured to
taste it, and finding it very
   nice (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed
flavour of cherry-tart,   
 custard, pineapple, roast turkey, coffee, and
hot buttered toast,)  
  she very soon finished it off.

"What a curious feeling!" said Alice. "I must be shutting
 up like a
telescope."

And so it was indeed: she was now only ten
 inches high, and her face
brightened up at the thought that she was
   now the right size for going
through that little door into that   
 lovely garden. First, however, she
waited for a few minutes to see  
 if she was going to shrink any further:
she felt a little nervous  
about this: "for it might end, you know," said
Alice to herself, "in
  my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder
what I should be  
like then?" And she tried to fancy what the flame of a
candle looks 
like after the candle is blown out, for she could not
remember ever 
having seen such a thing.

After a while, finding that nothing more
  happened, she decided on going
into the garden at once; but, alas  
 for poor Alice! when she got to the
door, she found she had forgo- 
tten the little golden key, and when she
went back to the table for 
it, she found she could not possibly reach
it: she could see it qui-
te plainly through the glass, and she tried her
best to climb up one
 of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;
and when she had
  tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing
sat down and  
 cried.

"Come, there's no use in crying like that!" said Alice to  
 herself,
rather sharply. "I advise you to leave off this minute!"  
She generally
gave herself very good advice (though she very seldom 
 followed it), and
sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to  
bring tears into her
eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her
  own ears for having
cheated herself in a game of croquet she was
