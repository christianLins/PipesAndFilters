master,
though. He was an old crab,    
_he_ was."

"I never went to him,"    
the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: "he   
taught
Laughing and Grief, they used   
to say."

"So he did, so he did,"     
said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn;  
and both
creatures hid their faces in  
their paws.

"And how many hours a    
day did you do lessons?" said Alice, in 
a hurry to
change the subje-           
ct.

"Ten hours the first day," said  
the Mock Turtle: "nine the next, and    
so
on."

"What a curious plan!"      
exclaimed Alice.

"That's the reason  
they're called lessons," the Gryphon    
remarked:
"because they lessen from    
day to day."

This was quite a new    
idea to Alice, and she thought over it  
a little
before she made her next      
remark. "Then the eleventh day must     
have been a
holiday."

"Of course it 
was," said the Mock Turtle.

"And     
how did you manage on the twelfth?"     
Alice went on eagerly.

"That's eno-  
ugh about lessons," the Gryphon inte-   
rrupted in a very decided
tone: "tell  
her something about the games           
now."




CHAPTER X


[Sideno-  
te: _The Lobster Quadrille_]

THE     
Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the 
back of one
flapper across his eyes.   
He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, 
but,
for a minute or two, sobs choked  
his voice. "Same as if he had a bone    
in
his throat," said the Gryphon: and  
it set to work shaking him and
punchi- 
ng him in the back. At last the Mock    
Turtle recovered his voice,
and, with  
tears running down his cheeks, went on  
again:

"You may not have lived much  
under the sea--" ("I haven't," said     
Alice)
"and perhaps you were never     
even introduced to a lobster--" (Alice  
began
to say "I once tasted----" but   
checked herself hastily, and said "No-  
,
never") "--so you can have no idea   
what a delightful thing a Lobster
Qu-  
adrille is!"

"No, indeed," said Ali- 
ce. "What sort of a dance is            
it?"

"Why," said the Gryphon, "you
