           And faintly strove that weary one
            To put the  
 subject by,
          "The rest next time--" "It _is_ next time!"
 
            The happy voices cry.

          Thus grew the tale of 
Wonderland:
            Thus slowly, one by one,
          Its qua-
int events were hammered out--
            And now the tale is done-
 ,
          And home we steer, a merry crew,
            Beneath  
    the setting sun.

          Alice! a childish story take,
    
             And with a gentle hand
          Lay it where Childho- 
    od's dreams are twined
            In Memory's mystic band,
    
          Like pilgrim's wither'd wreath of flowers
            Plu-
           ck'd in a far-off land.

          They all crowded round it panting and
             asking,
  "But who has won?"                 28

          "Why, Mary Ann,  
             what are you doing out

          An unusually large  
 saucepan flew close
             by it, and very nearly carried it  
  off      70

          It grunted again so violently that she
  
                 looked down into its face in some alarm    74

           The Queen turned angrily away from him
             and  
  said to the Knave, "Turn them over"   100

          The Queen   
never left off quarrelling
             with the other players, and 
   shouting
             "Off with his head!" or, "Off with her
   
                 head!"                                    116

          At this the whole   
 pack rose up into the

CHAPTER I


[Sidenote: _Down the Rabbi-  
   t-Hole_]

ALICE was beginning to get very tired of sitting by    
 her
sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice  
 she had
peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no
