a very curious sensation, which         
puzzled
her a good deal until she made 
out what it was: she was beginning      
to
grow larger again, and she thought  
at first she would get up and lea-      
ve
the court; but on second thoughts   
she decided to remain where she was     
as
long as there was room for          
her.

"I wish you wouldn't squeeze    
so," said the Dormouse, who was sitti-  
ng
next to her. "I can hardly breathe- 
."

"I can't help it," said Alice     
very meekly: "I'm growing."

"You've  
no right to grow _here_," said the use- 
mouse.

"Don't talk nonsense," said   
Alice more boldly: "you know you're     
growing
too."

"Yes, but _I_ grow at 
a reasonable pace," said the Dormouse;  
"not in
that ridiculous fashion." And  
he got up very sulkily and crossed      
over to
the other side of the cou-     
rt.

All this time the Queen had      
never left off staring at the Hatter,   
and,
just as the Dormouse crossed the  
court, she said to one of the offi-     
cers
of the court, "Bring me the list  
of the singers in the last concert!"    
on
which the wretched Hatter trembled  
so, that he shook off both his sho-     
es.

"Give your evidence," the King   
repeated angrily, "or I'll have you
e- 
xecuted, whether you're nervous or      
not."

"I'm a poor man, your Maje-    
sty," the Hatter began, in a trembling  
voice,
"--and I hadn't begun my tea-   
--not above a week or so--and what with 
the
bread-and-butter getting so thi-   
n--and the twinkling of the tea-        
----"

"The twinkling of _what_?"     
said the King.

"It _began_ with the  
tea," the Hatter replied.

"Of course 
twinkling _begins_ with a T!" said the  
King sharply. "Do you
take me for a    
dunce? Go on!"

"I'm a poor man," the 
Hatter went on, "and most things twi-   
nkled after
that--only the March Hare  
said----"

"I didn't!" the March Hare 
interrupted in a great hurry.

"You   
did!" said the Hatter.

"I deny it!"  
said the March Hare.

"He denies it,"
