this agreement.  There are a few
thi-  
ngs that you can do with most Project   
Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even     
without complying with the full terms   
of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C  
below.  There are a lot of things you   
can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm ele-  
ctronic works if you follow the terms   
of this agreement
and help preserve    
free future access to Project Gutenbe-

1.C.  The Project Gute-   
nberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the 
Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compi-   
lation copyright in the collection of   
Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works. 
  Nearly all the individual works in    
the
collection are in the public doma- 
in in the United States.  If an
indi-  
vidual work is in the public domain in  
the United States and you are
located  
in the United States, we do not claim a 
right to prevent you from
copying,     
distributing, performing, displaying or 
creating derivative
works based on     
the work as long as all references to   
Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of     
course, we hope that you will support   
the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of    
promoting free access to electronic     
works by
freely sharing Project Gute-  
nberg-tm works in compliance with the   
terms of
this agreement for keeping    
the Project Gutenberg-tm name associa-  
ted with
the work.  You can easily     
comply with the terms of this agreement 
by
keeping this work in the same       
format with its attached full Pro-      
ject
Gutenberg-tm License when you     
share it without charge with othe-      
rs.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the  
place where you are located also gove-  
rn
what you can do with this work.     
  Copyright laws in most countries are  
in
a constant state of change.  If you 
are outside the United States, che-     
ck
the laws of your country in addi-   
tion to the terms of this agreeme-      
nt
before downloading, copying,        
displaying, performing, distributing
