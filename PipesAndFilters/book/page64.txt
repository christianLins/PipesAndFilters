needn't be so proud
as all tha-        
t."

"With extras?" asked the Mock    
Turtle a little anxiously.

"Yes,"    
said Alice, "we learned French and      
music."

"And washing?" said the Mock 
Turtle.

"Certainly not!" said Alice  
indignantly.

"Ah! then yours wasn't  
a really good school," said the Mock    
Turtle in a
tone of relief. "Now at    
_ours_ they had at the end of the bill, 
'French,
music, _and washing_--extra-  
.'"

"You couldn't have wanted it     
much," said Alice; "living at the       
bottom of
the sea."

"I couldn't     
afford to learn it," said the Mock      
Turtle with a sigh. "I
only took the   
regular course."

"What was that?"    
inquired Alice.

"Reeling and Writhi- 
ng, of course, to begin with," the Mock 
Turtle
replied; "and then the diffe-   
rent branches of Arithmetic--Ambitio-   
n,
Distraction, Uglification, and sio- 
ision."

"I never heard of 'Uglifica- 
tion,'" Alice ventured to say. "What is 
it?"

The Gryphon lifted up both its  
paws in surprise. "Never heard of
u-   
glifying!" it exclaimed. "You know what 
to beautify is, I suppose?"

"Yes,"   
said Alice doubtfully: "it means--to-   
--make--anything--prettier."

"Well,  
then," the Gryphon went on, "if you     
don't know what to uglify is,
you are  
a simpleton."

Alice did not feel     
encouraged to ask any more questions    
about it, so she
turned to the Mock    
Turtle and said, "What else had you to  
learn?"

"Well, there was Mystery,"   
the Mock Turtle replied, counting off   
the
subjects on his flappers,          
"--Mystery, ancient and modern, aogra-  

Seaography: then Drawling--the Drawli- 
ng-master was an old conger-eel,
that  
used to come once a week: _he_ taught   
us Drawling, Stretching, and
Fainting  
in Coils."

"What was _that_ like?"   
said Alice.

"Well, I can't show it   
you myself," the Mock Turtle said: "I'm 
too
stiff. And the Gryphon never lea-  
rnt it."

"Hadn't time," said the     
Gryphon: "I went to the Classical
