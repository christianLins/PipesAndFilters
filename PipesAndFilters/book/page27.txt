 personal remarks now?" the Hatter asked triumphantly.

Alice did  
 not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself to
some  
 tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and
re- 
     peated her question. "Why did they live at the bottom of a      
well?"

The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, 
and then
said, "It was a treacle-well."

"There's no such thing!" 
Alice was beginning very angrily, but the
Hatter and the March Hare 
 went "Sh! sh!" and the Dormouse sulkily
remarked: "If you can't be  
 civil, you'd better finish the story for
yourself."

"No, please  
go on!" Alice said very humbly. "I won't interrupt you
again. I dare
  say there may be _one_."

"One, indeed!" said the Dormouse indi- 
gnantly. However, he consented to
go on. "And so these three little 
sisters--they were learning to draw,
you know----"

"What did they
 draw?" said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.

"Treacle," said 
the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.

"I want a cle-
    an cup," interrupted the Hatter: "let's all move one place
o-    
n."

He moved as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March
 Hare
moved into the Dormouse's place, and Alice rather unwillingly 
 took the
place of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who  
 got any
advantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse  
off than
before, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into 
his plate.

Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she
 began very
cautiously: "But I don't understand. Where did they draw
   the treacle
from?"

"You can draw water out of a water-well,"   
said the Hatter; "so I should
think you could draw treacle out of a 
 treacle-well--eh, stupid!"

"But they were _in_ the well," Alice  
    said to the Dormouse, not choosing
to notice this last rema-    
     rk.

"Of course they were," said the Dormouse; "----well      
in."

This answer so confused poor Alice that she let the Dormouse 
go on for
some time without interrupting it.

"They were learning 
to draw," the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing
its eyes, for it
   was getting very sleepy; "and they drew all manner of
things--e-  
  verything that begins with an M----"

"Why with an M?" said Ali-  
 ce.

"Why not?" said the March Hare.

Alice was silent.

The  
  Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into   
 a
dose; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with  
 a
little shriek, and went on: "----that begins with an M, such use- 
 
mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness--you know you  
 say
things are 'much of a muchness'--did you ever see such a thing  
 as a
drawing of a muchness?"

"Really, now you ask me," said Ali- 
 ce, very much confused, "I don't
think----"

"Then you shouldn't  
talk," said the Hatter.

This piece of rudeness was more than Alice
  could bear: she got up in
great disgust and walked off; the Dormo- 
use fell asleep instantly, and
neither of the others took the least 
  notice of her going, though she
looked back once or twice, half   
 hoping that they would call after her:
the last time she saw them,  
  they were trying to put the Dormouse into
the teapot.

"At any   
rate I'll never go _there_ again!" said Alice as she picked her
way 
  through the wood. "It's the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in   
all
my life!"

Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the
