first form into a line along the
se-   
a-shore----"

"Two lines!" cried the  
Mock Turtle. "Seals, turtles, and so    
on; then,
when you've cleared the      
jelly-fish out of the                   
way----"

"_That_ generally takes     
some time," interrupted the Grypho-     
n.

"--you advance twice----"

"Ea- 
ch with a lobster as a partner!" cried  
the Gryphon.

"Of course," the Mock   
Turtle said: "advance twice, set to     
partners----"

"--change lobsters,    
and retire in same order," continued    
the Gryphon.

"Then, you know," the   
Mock Turtle went on, "you throw the-    
----"

"The lobsters!" shouted the    
Gryphon, with a bound into the          
air.

"--as far out to sea as you     
can----"

"Swim, after them!" scre-   
amed the Gryphon.

"Turn a somersault 
in the sea!" cried the Mock Turtle,     
capering wildly
about.

"Change      
lobsters again!" yelled the Grypho-     
n.

"Back to land again, and--that's  
all the first figure," said the         
Mock
Turtle, suddenly dropping his     
voice; and the two creatures, who had   
been
jumping about like mad things all 
this time, sat down again very          
sadly
and quietly, and looked at Ali-  
ce.

"It must be a very pretty dance- 
," said Alice, timidly.

"Would you   
like to see a little of it?" said the   
Mock Turtle.

"Very much indeed,"     
said Alice.

"Come, let's try the     
first figure!" said the Mock Turtle to  
the Gryphon.
"We can do it without     
lobsters, you know. Which shall         
sing?"

"Oh, _you_ sing," said the    
Gryphon. "I've forgotten the            
words."

So they began solemnly       
dancing round and round Alice, every    
now and then
treading on her toes when 
they passed too close, and waving the-  
ir
forepaws to mark the time, while    
the Mock Turtle sang this, very slo-    
wly
and sadly:--

  "Will you walk a 
little faster?" said a whiting to a     
snail,
  "There's a porpoise close     
behind us, and he's treading on my tai-
