  he can _ever_ finish, if he doesn't begin."
But she waited pati-  
ently.

"Once," said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, "I 
  was a real
Turtle."

These words were followed by a very long   
silence, broken only by an
occasional exclamation of "Hjckrrh!" from
   the Gryphon, and the constant
heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle.   
  Alice was very nearly getting up and
saying "Thank you, sir, for   
 your interesting story," but she could not
help thinking there _mu- 
st_ be more to come, so she sat still and said
nothing.

"When we 
 were little," the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly,
though  
still sobbing a little now and then, "we went to school in the
sea. 
     The master was an old Turtle--we used to call him Tortoise-     
  ----"

"Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn't one?" Alice   
  asked.

"We called him Tortoise because he taught us," said the   
Mock Turtle
angrily: "really you are very dull!"

"You ought to be
  ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question,"
added the  
Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked at poor
Alice, who
 felt ready to sink into the earth. At last the Gryphon said
to the 
Mock Turtle, "Drive on, old fellow. Don't be all day about it!"
and 
  he went on in these words:

"Yes, we went to school in the sea,   
 though you mayn't believe it----"

"I never said I didn't!" inte- 
  rrupted Alice.

"You did," said the Mock Turtle.

"Hold your   
tongue!" added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again.
The Mock
   Turtle went on:--

"We had the best of educations--in fact, we   
went to school every
day----"

"_I've_ been to a day-school, too,"
  said Alice; "you needn't be so proud
as all that."

"With extra- 
 s?" asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.

"Yes," said Alice,  
 "we learned French and music."

"And washing?" said the Mock rta- 
 tle.

"Certainly not!" said Alice indignantly.

"Ah! then yours  
  wasn't a really good school," said the Mock Turtle in a
tone of   
relief. "Now at _ours_ they had at the end of the bill, 'French,
mu-
 sic, _and washing_--extra.'"

"You couldn't have wanted it much,"  
said Alice; "living at the bottom of
the sea."

"I couldn't afford
  to learn it," said the Mock Turtle with a sigh. "I
only took the  
regular course."

"What was that?" inquired Alice.

"Reeling and 
 Writhing, of course, to begin with," the Mock Turtle
replied; "and  
 then the different branches of Arithmetic--Ambition,
Distraction,  
 Uglification, and Derision."

"I never heard of 'Uglification,'"  
 Alice ventured to say. "What is it?"

The Gryphon lifted up both  
its paws in surprise. "Never heard of
uglifying!" it exclaimed. "You
  know what to beautify is, I suppose?"

"Yes," said Alice doubtfu- 
 lly: "it means--to--make--anything--prettier."

"Well, then," the  
  Gryphon went on, "if you don't know what to uglify is,
you are a   
 simpleton."

Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questi- 
ons about it, so she
turned to the Mock Turtle and said, "What else 
  had you to learn?"

"Well, there was Mystery," the Mock Turtle   
  replied, counting off the
subjects on his flappers, "--Mystery,   
ancient and modern, with
Seaography: then Drawling--the Drawling-ma-
ster was an old conger-eel,
that used to come once a week: _he_ tau-
 ght us Drawling, Stretching, and
Fainting in Coils."

"What was  
_that_ like?" said Alice.

"Well, I can't show it you myself," the
