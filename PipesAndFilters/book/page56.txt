to her. The Cat seemed to think that    
there
was enough of it now in sight,   
and no more of it appeared.

"I don't 
think they play at all fairly," Alice   
began, in rather a
complaining tone,   
"and they all quarrel so dreadfully one 
can't hear
oneself speak--and they     
don't seem to have any rules in parti-  
cular; at
least, if there are, nobody  
attends to them--and you've no idea     
how
confusing it is all the things     
being alive; for instance, there's the- 

arch I've got to go through next      
walking about at the other end of the-  

ground--and I should have croqueted   
the Queen's hedgehog just now, only
it 
ran away when it saw mine comi-         
ng!"

"How do you   
like the Queen?" said the Cat in a low  
voice.

"Not at all," said Alice:     
"she's so extremely----" Just then she  
noticed
that the Queen was close behi- 
nd her listening: so she went           
on,
"----likely to win, that it's      
hardly worth while finishing the game-  
."

The Queen smiled and passed       
on.

"Who _are_ you talking to?" said

"It's a friend of mine--a    
Cheshire Cat," said Alice: "allow me    
to
introduce it."

"I don't like the 
look of it at all," said the King:      
"however, it may
kiss my hand if it    
likes."

"I'd rather not," the Cat    
remarked.

"Don't be impertinent,"    
said the King, "and don't look at me    
like that!"
He got behind Alice as he  
spoke.

"A cat may look at a king,"   
said Alice. "I've read that in some     
book,
but I don't remember whe-        
re."

"Well, it must be removed,"     
said the King very decidedly, and he    
called
to the Queen, who was passing   
at the moment, "My dear! I wish you     
would
have this cat removed!"

The   
Queen had only one way of settling all
