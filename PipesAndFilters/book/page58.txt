had to do such a
thing before, and he  
wasn't going to begin at _his_ time of  
life.

The King's argument was, that  
anything that had a head could be
be-  
headed, and that you weren't to talk    
nonsense.

The Queen's argument was,  
that if something wasn't done about it  
in less
than no time, she'd have eve-  
rybody executed all round. (It was this 
last
remark that had made the whole    
party look so grave and anxi-           
ous.)

Alice could think of nothing   
else to say but "It belongs to the      
Duchess:
you'd better ask _her_ about  
it."

"She's in prison," the Queen    
said to the executioner; "fetch her     
here."
And the executioner went off    
like an arrow.

The Cat's head began  
fading away the moment he was gone, and 
by the time
he had come back with the  
Duchess, it had entirely disappeared;   
so the
King and the executioner ran    
wildly up and down looking for it, whi- 
le
the rest of the party went back to  
the game.




CHAPTER IX


[Si-

"YOU can't think how glad I am  
to see you again, you
dear old thing!" 
said the Duchess, as she tucked her     
arm affectionately
into Alice's, and   
they walked off together.

Alice was  
very glad to find her in such a pleasa- 
nt temper, and thought
to herself that 
perhaps it was only the pepper that     
had made her so
savage when they met   
in the kitchen.

"When _I'm_ a Duche- 
ss," she said to herself (not in a very 
hopeful tone
though), "I won't have    
any pepper in my kitchen _at all_. Soup 
does very
well without--Maybe it's     
always pepper that makes people hot-te- 
mpered,"
she went on, very much ple-   
ased at having found out a new kind of  
rule,
"and vinegar that makes them     
sour--and camomile that makes them
bi- 
tter--and--barley-sugar and such things 
that make children
sweet-tempered. I   
only wish people knew _that_: then they 
wouldn't be
so stingy about it, you    
know----"

She had quite forgotten
