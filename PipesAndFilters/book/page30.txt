side. She was
walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously
     into her face.

"Very," said Alice: "----where's the Duche-    
 ss?"

"Hush! Hush!" said the Rabbit in a low hurried tone. He loo- 
ked anxiously
over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself
  upon tiptoe, put
his mouth close to her ear, and whispered "She's  
under sentence of
execution."

"What for?" said Alice.

"Did you
  say 'What a pity!'?" the Rabbit asked.

"No, I didn't," said Ali- 
 ce: "I don't think it's at all a pity. I said
'What for?'"

"She  
   boxed the Queen's ears--" the Rabbit began. Alice gave a little-   
 
scream of laughter. "Oh, hush!" the Rabbit whispered in a frighte- 
 ned
tone. "The Queen will hear you! You see she came rather late,  
 and the
Queen said----"

"Get to your places!" shouted the Queen  
 in a voice of thunder, and
people began running about in all dire- 
 ctions, tumbling up against each
other; however, they got settled  
 down in a minute or two, and the game
began. Alice thought she had  
never seen such a curious croquet-ground in
all her life; it was all
 ridges and furrows; the balls were live
hedgehogs, the mallets live
   flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double
themselves up and to   
 stand upon their hands and feet, to make the
arches.

[Illustra- 
 tion]

The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing  
 her flamingo;
she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfo- 
 rtably enough, under
her arm, with its legs hanging down, but gene- 
rally, just as she had got
its neck nicely straightened out, and was
  going to give the hedgehog a
blow with its head, it _would_ twist  
itself round and look up in her
face, with such a puzzled expression
 that she could not help bursting
out laughing: and when she had got
 its head down, and was going to
begin again, it was very provoking 
to find that the hedgehog had
unrolled itself and was in the act of 
 crawling away: besides all this,
there was generally a ridge or a  
furrow in the way wherever she wanted
to send the hedgehog to, and, 
as the doubled-up soldiers were always
getting up and walking off to
  other parts of the ground, Alice soon came
to the conclusion that  
  it was a very difficult game indeed.

The players all played at   
   once without waiting for turns, quarrelling
all the while, and    
 fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time
the Queen was  
  in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and
shouting "Off   
   with his head!" or "Off with her head!" about once in a
minute-   
 .

Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure she had not as yet  
 had any
dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen  
 any minute,
"and then," thought she, "what would become of me? The- 
 y're dreadfully
fond of beheading people here: the great wonder is  
that there's any one
left alive!"

She was looking about for some 
way of escape, and wondering whether she
could get away without bei-
   ng seen, when she noticed a curious
appearance in the air: it    
 puzzled her very much at first, but, after
watching it a minute or  
two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said
to herself "It's the
  Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk
to."

"How are  
you getting on?" said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth
enough for
  it to speak with.

Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then  
 nodded. "It's no use
speaking to it," she thought, "till its ears
