full of smoke from
one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on 
  a three-legged stool in
the middle, nursing a baby, the cook was   
leaning over the fire, stirring
a large cauldron which seemed to be 
 full of soup.

"There's certainly too much pepper in that soup!"  
 Alice said to herself,
as well as she could for sneezing.

There  
was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess sneezed
o-
ccasionally; and the baby was sneezing and howling alternately witho-
  ut
a moment's pause. The only things in the kitchen that did not   
sneeze,
were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting on the hea-
  rth and
grinning from ear to ear.

"Please would you tell me,"   
 said Alice a little timidly, for she was not
quite sure whether it  
 was good manners for her to speak first, "why your
cat grins like  
 that?"

"It's a Cheshire cat," said the Duchess, "and that's why.  
Pig!"

She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice 
quite
jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to
   the baby,
and not to her, so she took courage, and went on aga-  
 in:

"I didn't know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I  
  didn't know
that cats _could_ grin."

"They all can," said the   
Duchess; "and most of 'em do."

"I don't know of any that do," Ali-
ce said very politely, feeling quite
pleased to have got into a rsa-
versation.

"You don't know much," said the Duchess; "and that's a 
fact."

Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and tho-
 ught it would
be as well to introduce some other subject of conve- 
 rsation. While she
was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cau- 
  ldron of soup off the
fire, and at once set to work throwing eve-  
rything within her reach at
the Duchess and the baby--the fire-irons
 came first; then followed a
shower of saucepans, plates, and dishe-
 s. The Duchess took no notice of
them even when they hit her; and  
 the baby was howling so much already,
that it was quite impossible  
 to say whether the blows hurt it or not.

"Oh, _please_ mind what  
   you're doing!" cried Alice, jumping up and down
in an agony of    
terror. "Oh, there goes his _precious_ nose"; as an
unusually large 
 saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it
off.

"If  
 everybody minded their own business," the Duchess said in a hoarse- 
    
growl, "the world would go round a deal faster than it doe-    
s."

"Which would _not_ be an adva- 
ntage," said Alice, who felt very glad to
get an opportunity of sho-
 wing off a little of her knowledge. "Just think
what work it would  
  make with the day and night! You see the earth
takes twenty-four   
 hours to turn round on its axis----"

"Talking of axes," said the  
 Duchess, "chop off her head."

Alice glanced rather anxiously at  
  the cook, to see if she meant to take
the hint; but the cook was   
 busily engaged in stirring the soup, and did
not seem to be liste- 
ning, so she ventured to go on again: "Twenty-four
hours, I _think_;
  or is it twelve? I----"

"Oh, don't bother _me_," said the Duche- 
 ss; "I never could abide
figures!" And with that she began nursing  
her child again, singing a
sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and 
       giving it a violent shake at
the end of every line:

       
           "Speak roughly to your little boy,
            And beat
